# hpc-bridge

**Drive a supercomputer from Claude Code.** Ask for a compute node in plain language; the agent finds the
facility, logs you in to Globus once, starts a one-node scheduler job (a *block*, and it asks before it spends
anything), runs your commands on that node, and releases it when you are done.

## Install

Two commands inside Claude Code; the repository is its own plugin marketplace.

```
/plugin marketplace add ryanchard/hpc-bridge
/plugin install hpc-bridge@hpc-bridge
```

Then ask *"What HPC facilities can I use?"* — that first answer needs no login and no configuration.

## What you bring, what's included

| You bring | Included |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | the plugin: the tools, and a skill the agent follows on its own, so plain requests work |
| **[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**, the only local prerequisite (it fetches Python 3.11 or newer itself if you don't have one) | the **public facility registry**: which machines exist and what each needs from you |
| **A Globus account**, logged in with the identity your facility knows you by (usually institutional or ACCESS) | the **Globus login in your terminal**: the browser opens once, the token is remembered |
| **Access to a facility**: an account whose Globus identity it has mapped (zero SSH), or an account plus key-based SSH to its login node in `~/.ssh/config` | the **endpoint bootstrap**: on an SSH facility hpc-bridge installs Globus Compute in your home directory there, then reconnects with no SSH — nothing for you to install on the machine |
| For an un-catalogued cluster, a minute to confirm the settings the agent discovers | **discovery** of that cluster's configuration, the **spend gate** before any billed block, and **idle self-release** |

Nothing hpc-bridge-specific is configured by hand. Details: **[Install](docs/user/install.md)** · **[Facilities](docs/user/facilities.md)**.

## Your first session

1. *What HPC facilities can I use?*
2. *Connect me to Anvil* — a facility from step 1, or *the cluster at `login.example.edu`* for one that isn't listed
3. *Run `hostname` on a compute node*
4. *Release the compute block*

The connect opens your browser for Globus; approve once. Before the first command the agent shows the
partition and account it will charge and asks you to confirm. Allocating a block takes a couple of minutes
on a quiet cluster; after that, commands run immediately and your working directory persists between them.
The **[Quickstart](docs/user/quickstart.md)** walks through each step and what to expect.

## How it works

SSH is a one-time bootstrap; everything after rides a Globus Compute endpoint. The connect step resolves a
machine from the registry, from a cluster you used before, or by probing a new login node, and both
discovery and compute then flow through the endpoint over Globus. A facility that runs its own multi-user
endpoint needs no SSH at all. Design, tool reference and module notes: the **[vault](docs/hpc-bridge-vault/Home.md)**.

## Status and security

Pre-release (v0.1.0). In the registry: **Purdue Anvil** (Slurm) and Globus Labs' cluster; also proven live through
the bring-your-own path on **Midway** (Slurm) and **ALCF Polaris** (PBS). Slurm and PBS are the supported schedulers.
Unit tests, lint and type checks run in CI. Every command after the bootstrap carries only a scoped Globus token,
never SSH material; SSH is key-only and used once to bootstrap. A password or Duo passcode is never handled
by the agent: it hands you an `ssh` command for your own terminal and shares that session. The agent runs
as you on the login node, so treat what it runs there as you would your own shell.
