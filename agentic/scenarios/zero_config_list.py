"""Stranger's walk, step 1 — with NO configuration at all: `list_facilities` must work out of the box
(the public registry id is built into the plugin and read anonymously), and the agent must tell the
user how each facility is reached (`access` / `access_note`: SSH account + key vs a facility-run
multi-user endpoint that maps your Globus identity) — WITHOUT connecting, provisioning or running
anything. Cheap: no cluster block, no SSH by the agent. Reads what the agent SAID (Trace.texts).
