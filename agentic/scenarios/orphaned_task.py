"""CHAOS: the endpoint manager dies under a polled long task — poll_task must report the task ORPHANED (#44) and the
agent must stop polling, say so, and release. Fake cluster only (the hook kills this run's endpoint manager).

Flow: bring up compute → ONE long run_shell on the compute shape (outlives the sync wait → `running` + task_id) →
the agent's first `poll_task` fires the hook (`globus-compute-endpoint stop <this run's endpoint>` as the pool user)
→ the manager deregisters, the web reports it offline → the next poll_task must be phase=failed with "ORPHANED"
(server._poll_task via warmth._endpoint_gone) → the agent reports it once, calls stop_endpoint (which answers
OFFLINE/ORPHANED, down) and finishes. Before hooks (review 2026-09-05, N6) this verdict existed only hermetically.
