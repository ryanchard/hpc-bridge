"""No account at a MEP facility — as a SECOND Globus identity the facility's identity mapping does not
know. The attach is identity-blind (`needs_account`, `reused=True`), then the first block start is
refused by the facility's manager (a synchronous 422: "Identity failed to map to a local user name …
Globus username: <who>") and hpc-bridge answers a terminal, STICKY `down` — "NO ACCOUNT at this
facility … (<identity>)". The agent must relay that once, quote the refused identity (what facility
support needs), not retry, not go around via SSH, and never ask for a password. Nothing is billed.

Knob: GLOBUS_DB_SECRET — run_smoke.sh mounts the storage.db named by $HPCB_TEST_GLOBUS_DB_NOACCOUNT
(set it in agentic/.env: a login as an identity with NO account on globus1 — e.g. a personal Google
identity; make it with `scripts/fresh_user_session.sh --reset` or `agentic/mep_no_account_check.py`).
