"""The facility-MEP path on the FAKE cluster (`mep` profile): a STRICT-schema multi-user endpoint in login01, our
Globus identity mapped to the local account `hpcbmep`. Zero SSH: connect_facility attaches (reused=True,
needs_account), the block is a billed Slurm block charged to `hpcb` (site enforces accounting), `stop_endpoint` is
draining-only (no cancel channel of ours), and the facility's idle-release (180 s here) reclaims the block.

The STRICT manager (Anvil's shape) refuses any key its schema does not list — compute, interface, worker_init — so
the plugin must DROP them and rely on the template's defaults (MEPFacility.sanitize_uec / dispatch_uec). That is the
'template-key gap' that blocks adding real MEPs to the registry, reproduced locally: if the plugin sends a forbidden
key the manager rejects the submission and no block ever comes.

The catalog is LOCAL (run_smoke.sh mounts this cluster's generated entries as HPC_BRIDGE_CATALOG_FILE): the MEP UUIDs
are minted per cluster. Graded like mep_compute_only, with the mapped user and idle-release of this facility.
