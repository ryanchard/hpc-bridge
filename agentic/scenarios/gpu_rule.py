"""A partition with a SITE RULE: the gpu partition rejects a block that requests no GPU (Delta's shape; the Anvil
gpu-debug QOS policy seen live 2026-09-04). Fake cluster, `site` profile.

The product path under test is #32: an sbatch the scheduler REFUSES is invisible to the Globus Compute client — the
manager is online, no worker ever comes, every poll reads 'allocating nodes…'. The plugin asks the scheduler (over
the free login shape) whether its pilot exists; past the cold-start grace a missing pilot is reported as 'likely
REJECTED'. The agent then has to find WHY (the endpoint log carries sbatch's stderr — the rule message) and either
satisfy the rule (a GPU request via the facility's scheduler_options) or tell the user the exact rule, instead of
polling a block that will never come.

Gated on the OUTCOME either way (`gpu_rule_handled`): the block ran on the GPU node with a GPU allocated (an agent
may know the rule up front and request the GPU from the start — nothing to surface then), OR the rejection was
surfaced by the tool AND the rule relayed to the user. `no_endless_wait` bounds the polling after a REJECTED notice.
