"""LIVE regression for #21 item 2: a long compute task completes via a poll handle (~5 min).

Before item 2, a single blocking run_shell task on the compute shape was CUT at ~110s (it never
returned `complete`). Now the client sync-wait is decoupled from the task ceiling: a task that outlives
the sync-wait comes back `phase="running"` with a `task_id`, keeps running on the block (which stays
warm because a running task holds it), and `poll_task` retrieves the full result. This scenario runs a
180s task and asserts it COMPLETES via that handle path — the inverse of the old `task_cap_probe`,
which observed the cut.

Deterministic on purpose (the prompt dictates the exact command + shape). Run with **--no-skill**
(`HPCB_NO_SKILL=1`) so the agent follows the literal instruction rather than skill-driven choices; the
`run_shell` "running" notice itself points at poll_task, so the handle path completes even without the
skill. One short billed block. See issue #21 (https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/21).
