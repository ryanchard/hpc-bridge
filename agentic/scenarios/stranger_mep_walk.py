"""The stranger's walk as ONE natural request, interactive (a cooperative simulated human): "show me what
I can use, get me onto the Globus Labs cluster, run hostname on a node, ask before spending, tidy up".
Less scripted than `mep_compute_only` — this is where a weaker model drifts: skipping the list, taking
the SSH path, confirming spend unprompted, re-polling a draining stop, misreading a zero spend.
Graded on the order (list before connect), the MEP attach (zero SSH), the compute run, the spend
question, and an honest draining-only stop. Costs a block on globus1 (~3 min agent + the facility's
600 s idle tail before the world check).

SERIAL: every MEP run maps to the same facility account (glabs) — two at once would share one user
endpoint (the block-thrashing collision, closed 2026-09-03). run_suite: --concurrency 1 for this one.
