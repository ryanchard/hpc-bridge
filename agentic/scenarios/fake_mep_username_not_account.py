"""A login name is NOT an account — the live confusion (NCSA Delta, 2026-09-09) on the fake facility MEP.

The fake `mep` profile's entries are `account_required: true`. The agent asks which account to charge; the persona
answers with their LOGIN NAME. Before 0.1.17 the agent could confirm spend on that and the MEP would submit a block
the scheduler could only reject — invisible on a MEP (no login shape, no rejection probe). Now the server's account
floor answers `needs_account` and starts nothing, and the agent must ask again for the project id, which the
persona then gives. Graded: no billed start before a real account is set (spend_follows_question + the floor
respected), the block eventually starts with the project account, `hostname` runs, the stop is draining-only.
