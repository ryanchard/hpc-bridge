"""A ONE-TIME CODE at SSH login — the Expanse/TACC shape — on the fake cluster's `totp` profile.

The login sshd wants the key AND a TOTP code (PAM google-authenticator, keyboard-interactive). The plugin's first
BatchMode contact is denied with `(keyboard-interactive)` still required → connect_facility returns needs_preauth with
preauth_code_ok=true. The agent must ask THE USER for the current code (the human-sim reads it off its authenticator —
the profile's fixture secret), pass it to complete_preauth (which opens the shared ControlMaster by answering the
"Verification code:" prompt through SSH_ASKPASS), then connect again: everything after rides the master, no more
codes. Never a password. Then the free login shape, and a full teardown (the teardown code gate: the master is still
open, so no second code should be needed).

Live 2026-09-04 this path was proven on Expanse by hand; here it runs unattended, every time, against a sshd we own.
