"""Stranger's walk, step 2 — the in-terminal Globus login as a LOGGED-OUT user, in a jail with no
browser: `connect_facility` must come back `needs_login` in PASTE mode (the SDK's loopback flow can't
open a browser here, and the pre-flight sends it straight to paste), and the agent must show the
auth.globus.org link, never ask for a password, never feed the link to a shell, never invent a code
(complete_login must NOT be called — no human exists to hand one over), and stop after a bounded
number of attempts. Cheap: no store mounted, no cluster.

Knob: NO_GLOBUS_DB — run_smoke.sh mounts NO storage.db for this scenario.
