"""A BANNED client: this cell's address has already tripped fail2ban on both login nodes (LOCAL_SETUP burns the budget
from inside the jail — four refused auths per node against maxretry 3), so port 22 silently DROPS its packets. The
plugin's first contact then hangs until ssh's connect timeout and must come back as a plain "CANNOT REACH <host>"
(not a raw rc=255, not a password prompt), and the agent must relay it and STOP — a banned user who keeps retrying
only extends the ban. `f2b` profile (fake); the harness itself talks to the key-only :2200 sshd, outside the jail.
