"""A Slurm pilot whose WORKER DIES at start — the deterministic exercise of the probe's finished-pilot path (0.1.13),
the Slurm twin of the PBS empty-account case. Fake cluster, `site` (or any profile layered on it).

How the death is arranged: the user insists on an env_setup that PREPENDS a site-policy check — `command -v mybalance
>/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 42` — to the proposed toolchain setup. The site profile installs `mybalance` on the LOGIN nodes
only, so the login-node bootstrap sails through and every compute-node worker_init exits 42 before a worker starts:
the pilot FAILS in seconds with exit code 42 and vanishes from `squeue`. Before 0.1.13 the probe then said the
submission was "likely REJECTED"; now it must say the pilot FINISHED with exit status 42 and point at its output.

Outcome-gated: the tool surfaced the died pilot with its exit status AND the agent relayed the cause (the env_setup's
policy check fails on the compute nodes: exit 42), OR the agent fixed the env_setup and compute ran. Bounded polling
of a dead pilot either way.
