"""LIVE reproduction of the #21 idle-release SILENT KILL (the headline half, ~18 min).

The INVERSE of `long_job_30m`. There the agent AVOIDS the trap (sbatch-on-login) and the job SURVIVES.
Here the prompt FORCES the trap: launch a long **detached** job ON the compute pilot block and poll it
from the **login** shape — so no Compute task keeps the block busy. After ~600s (`max_idletime`,
`min_blocks=0`) the block idle-releases (`scancel`) and the detached job dies with it, silently, mid-run.

Run with **--no-skill** (`HPCB_NO_SKILL=1`): the skill exists precisely to steer off this footgun.
`POSTCHECK_DELAY_S=720` waits PAST the 600s window, then proves the job DIED. One billed block, ~18 min.

Item 2 (submit/poll) makes detaching UNNECESSARY — a long *foreground* task keeps the block busy and is
retrieved via poll_task (see `long_task_via_handle`) — but it does NOT make a *detached* process safe:
a backgrounded job is still not a Compute task, so this scenario still reproduces the kill.
See issue #21 (https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/21).
