"""The facility multi-user-endpoint (MEP) path: a catalogued compute-only facility, ZERO SSH.

`connect_facility("globus1")` resolves the Globus Search index entry for `globus-cluster-mep` (a
facility-run, identity-mapped MEP on globus1) and ATTACHES — nothing is bootstrapped, no SSH is made,
and the result is `needs_account` at once with `reused=True`. The facility is compute-only: the MEP
schema refuses hpc-bridge's LocalProvider login shape, so there is no free login node — every command
runs on a billed Slurm block that stays warm between calls (`init_blocks: 1`). No account is needed
(AccountingStorageEnforce=none). `stop_endpoint` is DRAINING-ONLY: hpc-bridge owns no cancel channel
to the facility's block, so `draining` is terminal and must NOT be re-polled for `down`.

Graded on what the MEP path must never do (any login-shape submit, any SSH), what it must do
(the identity-mapped compute run, a warm block), and that stop stays honest (`draining`, never `down`).
The world check names the MAPPED account (glabs) — the universal `stop_honesty_no_pilot_left` keys on
`$(whoami)` (the pool user) and would pass vacuously here — and waits past the facility's 600 s
idle-release, the only thing that reclaims the block.

The registry id is built into the plugin (anonymous reads: no index env, no Search scope needed). The
identity in the mounted storage.db must be one the MEP maps (gusellerm@uchicago.edu -> glabs today);
an unmapped identity is the `mep_no_account` scenario.

⚠ The harness' own teardown (`scancel -u $(whoami)`) cannot touch glabs's block — on this facility
only the idle-release reclaims it; globus1 is unmetered. Expected ≈ 3 min agent + 11 min settle.
