"""The registry wins over a stale local cache (decision 2026-09-03). The jail's `facilities.json` is
pre-seeded with an SSH-era BYO config for `globus-labs` — exactly what the maintainer's own cache held —
and the registry serves `globus-labs` as a facility MEP. `connect_facility("globus-labs")` must ATTACH to the
MEP (reused=True, zero SSH, no probe) and never take the cached SSH path. Attach only: no block, no
spend. Cheap.

Knob: SEED_FACILITY_CACHE — run.py writes it into the server's ~/.hpc-bridge/facilities.json before
the agent starts.
