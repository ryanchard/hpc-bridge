"""LIVE end-to-end bring-up of ALCF **Aurora** — the first **PBS** + **bastion/MFA** facility in the
harness. Exercises the scheduler-neutral compute path (#28) against a real PBS Pro system and, above
all, **validates the `interface=hsn0` guess**: if the worker registers (the canary goes warm), hsn0 is
the right address_by_interface for the login-node interchange; if it stays `provisioning`, it isn't.

Aurora is un-indexed, so the prompt hands the agent the discovered `FacilityDetails` (see the vault's
Aurora bring-up note) to connect with — the discovery probe's NIC heuristic would mis-guess the
interface, so we supply the known values and let the **login canary validate** them.

PRECONDITIONS (this scenario CANNOT run in the Docker jail — the container can't do the two-hop MFA):
  1. ~/.ssh/config has an `aurora` alias: ProxyJump bastion.alcf.anl.gov, User <you>, and
     `ControlPath ~/.hpc-bridge/cm/%C` (the SERVER's control dir — so its BatchMode calls reuse your
     master) + `ControlMaster auto` + `ControlPersist 1h`. `mkdir -p ~/.hpc-bridge/cm`.
  2. Pre-open the master ONCE (enter both passcodes — bastion + login): `ssh -fN aurora`.
  3. Run LOCALLY (not run_smoke.sh):
        export HPC_BRIDGE_SSH_HOST=aurora HPC_BRIDGE_SSH_USER=<you> \
               HPC_BRIDGE_SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/id_ed25519 \
               HPC_BRIDGE_USER_DIR=~/.globus_compute CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=...
        python agentic/harness/run.py aurora_pbs_bringup
     (HPC_BRIDGE_SSH_KEY is required by the harness but UNUSED for Aurora — auth rides the master;
     it's harmless because ControlMaster reuse never re-authenticates.)

See issue #28 (PBS support) and the vault note `Planned/Aurora (PBS + bastion) bring-up.md`.
