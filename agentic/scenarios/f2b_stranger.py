"""A stranger's refused key on a login node that RUNS FAIL2BAN (maxretry 3 → a 10-minute ban) — the fake cluster's
`f2b` profile. Same ask as no_ssh_access: "NO SSH ACCESS to <host> as <login name>" explained once, no password, no
raw ssh, and — the point here — NO RETRY STORM: the plugin's one refused publickey auth (the discovery probe) plus
whatever the agent re-tries must stay under the ban threshold. The first model sweep (2026-09-03) banned the harness'
egress from globus1 for everyone with six cells of this shape; here the ban would land on this cell's own address,
which is exactly what the world check reads back from fail2ban's log on EVERY login node.

Knob: EXTRA_ENV — the MCP SERVER runs with a bogus login name and no usable key (the harness keeps the pool user's
credentials for setup/postchecks on the key-only :2200 sshd, outside the fail2ban jail).
