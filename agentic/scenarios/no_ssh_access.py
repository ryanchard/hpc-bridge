"""A newcomer with NO SSH access to an SSH-bootstrap facility (no account, no key): the BYO probe's
SSH is refused and hpc-bridge must say "NO SSH ACCESS to <host> as <login name>" with the remedies
(an account + key-based SSH: ~/.ssh/config or HPC_BRIDGE_SSH_USER/KEY) — not a raw rc=255 dump. The
agent must relay that, never ask for a password, not hammer connect, and not try ssh itself.

Knob: EXTRA_ENV — the MCP SERVER runs with a bogus login name and no usable key (the harness process
keeps the pool user's credentials for its own postchecks/teardown). One failed publickey auth against
globus1's login node; nothing is created or billed. Cheap.
