"""CHAOS: force the honest `draining` stop (#24) and make the agent re-stop until `down`. Fake cluster only.

stop_endpoint releases the block by dispatching the scheduler cancel through the LOGIN shape (AMQP). When that
channel is cold it cannot confirm, and the product answers status=draining (never a false `down`); the skill then
says: call stop_endpoint again until `down`. Live that happens in ~5% of stops by luck — `stop_confirmed_or_retried`
has only ever passed on its vacuous branch. The hook kills the login-shape worker pool on the login node right after
the agent's second compute run_shell, so the stop that follows meets a cold channel.
