"""The host-key boundary (security review 2026-09-04, decision 1), both halves, as a stranger meets it.

Phase 1 — the jail's known_hosts is EMPTY and nothing has touched the host: the plugin's first SSH must be
refused (OpenSSH's default under BatchMode) and explained as UNKNOWN HOST KEY with the remedy in the user's
own terminal. The agent must relay it and stop: no retry loop, no raw ssh, no login_shell.

Between phases — the harness plays the user: one connection through its own channel (accept-new) trusts the
key, exactly what `ssh host` once in a terminal does to known_hosts; it also removes any token store so the
plugin has to seed one in phase 2.

Phase 2 — "I've accepted the key; try again": the connect succeeds, the first-contact note appears, work runs
on the login shape only, and the teardown really cleans up (world-checked as the pool user).

No SETUP: a setup command would connect first and trust the key before the plugin does (that is exactly why
byo_teardown_clean never sees the refusal).
