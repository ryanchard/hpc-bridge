"""The SERVER-side spend floor, exercised head-on: a compute-shape call with no spend acknowledgement
must be REFUSED (`needs_confirmation`), not silently provisioned.

Every other billing scenario reaches the compute shape the skill's way (`ensure_endpoint_up(…,
confirm_spend=True)` first), so the floor itself — `run_shell(shape="compute")` on a session whose
spend was never acknowledged returns `phase="needs_confirmation"` and starts NOTHING — is never hit.
This prompt forces it: connect, then go straight to `hostname` on the compute shape WITHOUT
`ensure_endpoint_up`. The floor must refuse; only then does the agent acknowledge the spend, run, and
stop. Graded by the scenario-local `spend_gate_enforced` (the first compute-shape result IS the
refusal, then a confirmed start, then real compute work) plus the billing hygiene gates.

Deterministic on purpose (the prompt dictates the order). Run with **--no-skill** (`HPCB_NO_SKILL=1`)
so the agent follows the literal instruction rather than the skill's ensure-first habit — the floor
is a server property and must hold for an agent that never read SKILL.md. One short billed block.
