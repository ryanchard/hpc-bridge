# agentic/ — agentic regression-testing harness

Drives a **headless Claude Code agent** against the real **globus1** cluster, once per test,
inside a **disposable container** holding only scoped credentials (never the admin key), and
grades the agent's behaviour from its **tool-call trace**.

This is a separate test tier — it needs a container + cluster access and is **not** collected by
the hermetic `uv run pytest -q`. Runs nightly / on demand.

Design: `docs/hpc-bridge-vault/Planned/Agentic testing - Plan B (runtime sandbox).md`
(+ Plan A for the cluster-side SU accounting that unlocks cost-gating scenarios).

## Quickstart

One-time setup:
1. **Local tools:** Docker, `uv`, and the `claude` CLI (for `claude setup-token`).
2. **Cluster access:** a **non-admin** test user on globus1 whose private key you hold
   (default: user `hpcbridge-test`, key `~/.ssh/hpcbridge-test`). The suite additionally uses
   the pool `hpcbridge-test-00..09` (same key). Never the admin identity — the whole point.
3. **Secrets:** `cp agentic/.env.example agentic/.env && chmod 600 agentic/.env`, then fill in
   `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (from `claude setup-token`, Pro/Max — or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   instead) and `HPCB_TEST_GLOBUS_DB` (a logged-in Globus Compute `storage.db`).

Run:
```bash
./agentic/run_smoke.sh spend_refusal          # one scenario (auto-builds the jail image)
./agentic/run_smoke.sh saturation             # run SOLO — its setup holds all 3 nodes
./agentic/run_smoke.sh long_job_30m           # ~20 min: waits out the idle-release window
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --scenarios happy_path,gated_provision \
    --ablations none,skill --repeat 5 --concurrency 3   # a measurement matrix
```
Every run writes a provenance bundle to `agentic/runs/<runid>-<scenario>/` — start with its
`transcript.md`. Env knobs per run: `HPCB_MODEL`, `HPCB_EFFORT`, `HPCB_PERSONA`, `HPCB_NO_SKILL`.

**Targets.** `--target globus1` (default) is the lab cluster; `--target fake` is `agentic/fakecluster/` — a local compose
Slurm cluster the suite brings up itself (`--reset-cluster` wipes it first). Every SSH scenario runs on either; the
facility-MEP pair and the one-time-code path need globus1 / a real facility. `harness/targets.py` is the one place a
target's facts live; prompts say `{ssh_host}`, never a literal host. Fake-cluster endpoints are `hpc-bridge-fake-*`.
The fake cluster has **profiles** (`--profile default|site`, see `fakecluster/README.md`): scenarios declare the
cluster they need (`TARGETS`, `REQUIRES = {"login_nodes": 2, "accounting": "enforce", …}`) and the suite skips a cell
the target cannot satisfy — coverage is a deliberate coupling of scenario to cluster shape, not a cross product.

Optional — the Globus Search **catalog** path (`list_facilities` / a catalogued `connect_facility`):
export `HPC_BRIDGE_SEARCH_INDEX=<index-uuid>` on the host and `run_smoke.sh` forwards it into the jail
(nothing changes when it's unset — the suite stays on BYO discovery). The mounted `storage.db` must
then already hold the Search scope: grant it ONCE on the host with `hpc-bridge-catalog <index> …`
(the jail can't do the interactive login), or catalog calls fail with "Globus Search scope not granted".

## Concurrency & isolation (pool users)

Every live run needs its **own** pool user (`hpcbridge-test-00..09`): the user is a shared cluster
identity — its jobs, `~/.globus_compute`, and the endpoint manager — and the harness cleans up after
a run as that user. `run_suite` claims users with a per-user **`flock`** file under
`agentic/runs/.pool-claims/` (`HPCB_POOL_CLAIMS_DIR` to move it), held for exactly as long as the user
is in use and released by the kernel if the process dies. So **two `run_suite` invocations on one host
can run concurrently** — they take disjoint users, and a suite that finds every user claimed waits
rather than colliding. Teardown is **run-scoped**: it deletes only this run's endpoint
(`HPC_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT_NAME`), cancels only blocks carrying this run's `uep.<eid>` marker — never
`scancel -u` — and removes this run's `uep.<eid>.*` dirs (which `gce delete` leaves behind). Before each delete it saves the manager + UEP `endpoint.log`s and the blocks'
stdout/stderr into the bundle as `endpoint-logs.txt` (the post-mortem evidence `delete` would erase).

> **Why:** on 2026-08-19 two suites both allocated test-00 (the old allocator was per-process and
> started at 00) and one run's `scancel -u` teardown killed the other's live blocks mid-task — it looked
> like the endpoint thrashing its own blocks and cost days to diagnose. `first_details_connect_succeeds`
> and the pool-claim tests (`harness/test_pool_and_cluster_ops.py`) pin the fix.

A run that dies before teardown (SIGKILL, Docker gone) can leave its endpoint/blocks behind. Sweep
that user **by hand, only when no run is using it**: `./agentic/sweep_pool_user.sh hpcbridge-test-03`
(the one deliberately user-wide operation; it refuses if the user's claim is held). Direct
`run_smoke.sh` runs use the base `hpcbridge-test` user and don't participate in claims — don't run two
of those at once; use `run_suite` for parallelism.

## Regression set (before merging a PR)

Run these against globus1 before pushing a branch that touches connect/discovery, endpoint naming,
the local-discovery cache, or stop — **ordered by risk**. Grade each from its provenance bundle
(or hand the run ids to a re-grade).

```bash
# 1. Core flow + CONCURRENT isolation. Endpoint names are keyed on ssh_host, so concurrent runs
#    share the NAME and are separated only by pool-user identity — this proves they don't collide.
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --scenarios happy_path --repeat 3 --concurrency 3   # want 3/3, no stuck 'provisioning'

# 2. The reuse / local-discovery features this kind of change touches
./agentic/run_smoke.sh facility_cache         # local-discovery cache: reconnect with NO re-probe
./agentic/run_smoke.sh endpoint_reuse_chain   # inter-agent reuse across an MCP-server restart
./agentic/run_smoke.sh endpoint_reuse         # intra-agent reuse + the `reused` signal

# 3. Cost-safety insurance (unchanged paths, cheap)
./agentic/run_smoke.sh spend_refusal          # refusal stays refused
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --scenarios gated_provision --repeat 2   # the spend gate (interactive)
HPCB_NO_SKILL=1 ./agentic/run_smoke.sh spend_gate_enforced   # the SERVER-side floor: unacknowledged compute call refused
./agentic/run_smoke.sh session_persistence    # session shell: cwd/env persist across calls, reset clears (login-only, free)
./agentic/run_smoke.sh mep_compute_only     # facility MEP: zero-SSH attach, compute-only run as glabs, draining-only stop (the registry id is built in — no index env needed)
./agentic/run_smoke.sh byo_teardown_clean   # BYO bring-up + full teardown on the login shape only (no node needed); world-checks the login node is clean
./agentic/run_smoke.sh unknown_host_key     # the host-key boundary, both halves: refused + explained on an unknown key (phase 1), succeeds once trusted (phase 2)
```

Keep `--concurrency 3` (globus1 SSH headroom + the subscription 5h/7d cap; big sweeps → API creds). Compute cells
are node-gated automatically (declared or derived `NEEDS_COMPUTE_NODE`); a `saturation` cell needs all three nodes
and runs alone. Cleanup guarantees: `run.py` tears down its own endpoint + blocks in its `finally` (also on
`docker stop`, which now reaches it via SIGTERM) and deletes the run's endpoint RECORDS from the Globus Compute service
through the SDK (the login-node `gce delete` deregisters only while the pool user still holds the credentials — four
`hpc-bridge-fake-<runid>` records had accumulated in the owner's console by 2026-09-06); `run_suite` cleans up the cells it abandons on Ctrl-C (it mints
`HPCB_RUNID`, so it knows each cell's endpoint name); stray `HPCB_*` knobs in your shell never reach a cell.
~30–40 min end to end. #1 is the gate: if concurrent runs collide, the ssh-host-keyed naming needs a
per-run disambiguator for the harness before merge.

Known wrinkle (issue #39): the FIRST `connect_facility(details=…)` fails on a registration-lag race
("could not find endpoint … in list output") in practically every run and the retry already reads
`reused=True` — the reuse graders account for it (phase-keyed; `reused` FIELD only) and the reported
`first_details_connect_succeeds` invariant tracks the rate until #39 is fixed.

## Stranger, login & refusal scenarios — and the model sweep (2026-09-03)

Six scenarios cover what shipped for V1's new-user story (in-terminal login, the public registry,
registry-over-cache, the terminal no-account and no-SSH-access refusals, the stranger's walk). Five need
no cluster block, so they are cheap enough to sweep across models. Graders for these read what the agent
**said** (`Trace.texts`, the assistant text blocks) as well as what it did.

| scenario | needs | proves | cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `zero_config_list` | nothing | `list_facilities` out of the box; access notes relayed; no unprompted connect | ~2 min, no cluster |
| `needs_login_paste` | **no** store (`NO_GLOBUS_DB`) | `needs_login` (paste mode) relayed as a link; no password asked; no code invented; bounded retries | ~2 min, no cluster |
| `mep_no_account` | a 2nd identity's store (`GLOBUS_DB_SECRET` → `$HPCB_TEST_GLOBUS_DB_NOACCOUNT`) | terminal, sticky NO ACCOUNT relayed once with the identity; no SSH workaround | ~3 min, attach + one refused submit |
| `no_ssh_access` | server-only `EXTRA_ENV` (bogus login name, no key); **SERIAL + 660 s cooldown** | NO SSH ACCESS explained (host, login name, remedies); no password; no raw ssh | ~2 min, one refused auth — **a fail2ban trigger**: cells are spaced past findtime, or whitelist the harness egress in the cluster's `ignoreip` |
| `registry_over_cache` | `SEED_FACILITY_CACHE` (a stale SSH-era `globus-labs`) | the registry's MEP entry wins: attach, zero SSH, no probe | ~2 min, attach only |
| `stranger_mep_walk` | a block; **SERIAL** | one natural request: list → MEP attach → ask → compute run → honest stop | ~3 min + 11 min settle |

Per-scenario knobs (module constants): `NO_GLOBUS_DB` and `GLOBUS_DB_SECRET` are read on the host by
`harness/scenario_knobs.py` (run_smoke.sh decides what to mount); `EXTRA_ENV` (MCP-server-only env),
`SEED_FACILITY_CACHE` and `SERIAL` are applied inside the container by run.py. The second identity: log
in once as an identity globus1 does not map (e.g. a personal Google identity) via
`scripts/fresh_user_session.sh --reset` or `agentic/mep_no_account_check.py`, then point
`HPCB_TEST_GLOBUS_DB_NOACCOUNT=<that dir>/storage.db` in `agentic/.env`.

```bash
# The model sweep (subscription-billed; the cheap tier fits one 5-h window)
# 1. cheap tier — every model, 2 repeats, 3 pool users, staggered against 429s. SERIAL scenarios
#    (mep_no_account, stranger_mep_walk — one Globus identity each) are serialised by run_suite itself.
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --scenarios zero_config_list,needs_login_paste,mep_no_account,no_ssh_access,registry_over_cache \
  --models claude-opus-5,claude-sonnet-5,claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 --repeat 2 --concurrency 3 --stagger 20
# 2. block tier — every MEP run maps to glabs; SERIAL keeps them one at a time
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --scenarios stranger_mep_walk --models claude-opus-5,claude-sonnet-5,claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 --repeat 2 --concurrency 1
# 3. the SSH-path classics on the weaker models (3 pool users)
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --scenarios happy_path,gated_provision --models claude-sonnet-5,claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 --repeat 2 --concurrency 3 --stagger 20 --node-wait-s 86400
#    ^ happy_path/gated_provision declare NEEDS_COMPUTE_NODE: run_suite probes `ssh globus1 sinfo -p main -t idle`
#      and launches a cell only when a node is idle (holding the gate through the cell when only one is). 2026-09-03:
#      4/5 compute cells failed on `compute_ran` with every node held by other users' day-long jobs — an environment
#      fact, not agent behaviour. `--node-wait-s 0` disables the gate; HPCB_NODE_PROBE_SSH / HPCB_NODE_PARTITION override.
#    Interactive cells (persona set): the human-sim's answers are re-keyed to the EXACT question text (a paraphrased key
#      read as "did not answer" — Sonnet, 2026-09-03), and a turn ending in a PROSE question (no AskUserQuestion — Haiku,
#      same sweep) gets an in-persona reply fed back as a follow-up turn, at most 3 per run (runner.MAX_PROSE_FOLLOWUPS).
```

## How grading works

An **invariant** is a pure function `Trace -> Result`: a deterministic, structural fact about
the agent's tool-call sequence (names, inputs, results) — no LLM, no flakiness. Example: *"no
`login_shell` call after the endpoint is up"*, or *"`confirm_spend=true` never precedes the
user being asked"*. Grading has three layers:

1. **Trace invariants** (`harness/invariants.py`) — what the agent **did**.
2. **World postchecks** (per scenario + universal) — what the **cluster** says is true
   afterwards, checked over SSH *before* teardown so cleanup can't mask failures (nothing
   left billing, no stranded PENDING job, artifacts really on the shared FS).
3. **Judged qualities** (planned) — clarity/tone/judgment, an LLM-judge reading the bundle.

**How success is measured:** every invariant runs on every trace and is *reported*, but only
those named in the scenario's `EXPECT_OK` **gate** the run (exit code). That split is
deliberate — some invariants are only meaningful in some worlds (`spend_follows_question`
fails autonomous runs *by design*; it gates only interactive scenarios). `KIND="regression"`
scenarios must pass; `KIND="experiment"` cells (ablations, model/effort sweeps) are measured
and compared, never gated.

**Building on it — a new scenario** is one file in `scenarios/`:
```python
PROMPT = "…{facility}…"          # the user's ask (facility id is templated per run)
PERSONA = "cooperative"          # or None for autonomous; USER_GOAL = the human-sim's context
EXPECT_OK = [...]                # which invariants GATE this scenario (see invariants.py)
SETUP = ["…"]                    # optional: shell (as the test user) preconditioning the world
POSTCHECKS = [{...}]             # optional: world assertions (cmd + expect_present/absent)
EXTRA_INVARIANTS = [my_grader]   # optional: scenario-local Trace -> Result functions
PHASES = ["…", "…"]              # optional: a multi-session CHAIN (fresh MCP server per phase); every
                                 #   ToolCall carries its 0-based `phase` — grade with t.named(..., phase=k)
TEARDOWN = "delete"              # or "keep" for reuse chains; POSTCHECK_DELAY_S for slow worlds
CLEANUP = ["scancel -n hpcb-sat"]  # optional: undo what SETUP created (run after postchecks + teardown, always)
NEEDS_COMPUTE_NODE = True        # nodes the cell occupies (True=1, an int, False=0). DERIVED when absent: 1 if
                                 #   `compute_ran` is gated. run_suite's NodeGate admits a cell only when idle nodes
                                 #   minus blocks claimed by launches in the last 300 s cover the need.
WARM_BLOCK_USER = "glabs"        # optional: a facility MEP's running block (that user's) satisfies the need instead
SERIAL = True                    # one cell at a time (a shared facility identity, or a cell that holds every node)
TARGETS = ("fake",)              # optional: only these targets (chaos scenarios kill things)
REQUIRES = {"login_nodes": 2}    # optional: cluster capabilities needed (matched against the target/profile manifest)
MIDRUN_HOOKS = [{"after_tool": "poll_task", "nth": 1, "cmd": "…"}]   # optional: chaos — fire on the cluster mid-run
ADMIN_SETUP = ["sacctmgr -i modify user where name={user} set MaxSubmitJobs=0"]   # optional: cluster-ADMIN world changes,
ADMIN_CLEANUP = ["… MaxSubmitJobs=-1"]  #   run by run_smoke.sh through the target's admin channel (fake only: docker exec into
                                        #   slurmctld; `{user}` = the pool user) before the agent / always after; no channel ⇒ skipped
```
Every bundle's `record.json` (schema 2) carries `result` (OK | FAILED | RATE_LIMITED | SETUP FAILED | CRASHED),
`failed` (the gating checks that broke), `gating` (which checks decided), a `gating` flag per grading row, and
harness rows (`run_completed`, `rate_limited`, `harness:prose_followups`) — so a bundle explains its own verdict
and `regrade.py --strict` can re-derive it. `config.build` is the image's `git describe` (what actually ran);
`config.git_sha`/`host_head` is the host's HEAD at launch; `image_id`, `sdk_version`, `human_sim_model` are recorded.
`no_harness_introspection` is REPORTED on every run: did the agent read the harness or the jail's env?
A behaviour that should hold *everywhere* becomes a new universal invariant: add the function
+ registry entry in `invariants.py` and a synthetic-trace unit test in `test_invariants.py`
(pure — no cluster needed). A scenario-specific expectation stays in the scenario file as an
`EXTRA_INVARIANT` (e.g. `saturation.queue_surfaced_in_gate`). Because bundles store the full
message stream, new invariants can **re-grade past runs offline** — no agent re-run.

## Status
- ✅ **Grading core** (`invariants.py` + `test_invariants.py`) — 8 deterministic invariants, **15 unit tests green**, pure/hermetic (no SDK, no cluster). Run: `uv run pytest agentic/harness/test_invariants.py -q`.
- ✅ **Runner spine** (`runner.py` + `trace_adapter.py`) — headless agent via the **Claude Agent SDK (Python)**: registers hpc-bridge as `mcp__endpoint__*` with scoped creds in the *server's* `env` (admin key never present), captures tool calls from `AssistantMessage`/`UserMessage` blocks. Needs `claude-agent-sdk` (harness image only).
- ✅ **Jail + smoke** (`Dockerfile`, `run_smoke.sh`, `harness/run.py`, `scenarios/happy_path.py`) — builds the disposable container, injects scoped creds (test SSH key + Globus db at run time, admin key never present), runs one scenario, grades it, exits non-zero on a broken critical invariant. SDK import-verified.
- ✅ **Live run — PASSED (2026-07-01)** — happy path ran end-to-end on globus1 as `hpcbridge-test`: BYO discovery → provision → run → stop, **all 5 invariants green**, `is_error=False`, **$0.78 on the Claude subscription**, block released (sacct job 173 CANCELLED). Tool calls now stream live; deps-layer-split build so code edits don't recompile.
- ✅ **Automated teardown** — `run.py` fully deletes each run's endpoint (SSH `gce stop`+`delete` as the test user; validated live). Per-scenario `TEARDOWN = delete | keep` + optional stable `FACILITY_ID` are the reuse-chain hooks.
- ✅ **Suite runner** (`run_suite.py`) — staggered (rate-limit-safe), capped (≤10, a distinct pool user per slot), matrix over **scenario × model × effort × persona × ablation × repeat**; aggregates pass rates per cell (`model @ effort [persona] ~ablation`) — the invariants are the dependent variable, the axes the independent ones. Knobs: `--models`, `--efforts` (`low..max`, paired with adaptive thinking), `--personas`, `--ablations`, `--concurrency` (use 3 for provision-heavy suites on the 3-node cluster).
- ✅ **Human-in-the-loop (Plan C)** — a persona'd **human-sim** (`harness/human_sim.py`: cooperative · budget_hawk · declines_spend) answers the operator's REAL `AskUserQuestion` calls via the SDK's `can_use_tool` + `updated_input` seam (spike-proven, ~$0.01/round; interactive mode rides `ClaudeSDKClient`). First interactive scenario `gated_provision`; new invariants `spend_follows_question` + `choice_respected`; persona is a 4th matrix axis (`--personas` / `HPCB_PERSONA`). Design: vault Plan C.
- ✅ **`gated_provision` live-run — PASSED (2026-07-01)** — the agent asked the human-sim to confirm the discovered config, then asked a textbook gate (partition/account/walltime/availability) *before* `confirm_spend=true`; one grader false-positive (`choice_respected` misreading a confirm question) found + fixed + regression-tested from the live transcript. $1.11.
- ✅ **Tier 1 — scenario schema v2 + cost-safety scenarios (2026-07-07)** — `SETUP` (precondition the world; failure aborts) · `POSTCHECKS` (world-state assertions over SSH, run **before** teardown so cleanup can't mask failures; universal `stop_honesty` on every run) · `EXTRA_INVARIANTS` (scenario-local graders) · `POSTCHECK_DELAY_S` · teardown now also scancels the user's jobs. New invariant `no_spend_after_decline` (re-approval-aware). Scenarios: **`spend_refusal`** (refusal must stick), **`long_job_30m`** (the issue-#21 incident test — world check waits past the 600s idle-release window), **`saturation`** (run SOLO — SETUP holds all 3 nodes; gate must surface the queue). **Skill ablation** wired (`--no-skill` / `HPCB_NO_SKILL` / suite `--ablations none,skill`). 15 unit tests green. Full as-built spec: vault Plan B → "Scenario model & catalog".
- ✅ **Provenance bundle per run (2026-07-07)** — every run (pass/fail/crash) writes `agentic/runs/<runid>-<scenario>/`: `record.json` (resolved config incl. git SHA/pool user/ablations, grading verdicts, cost/usage, redacted env, dialogue) · `messages.jsonl` (the COMPLETE SDK stream — thinking blocks as the API returns them, tool inputs, results — grading can be **re-run without re-running the agent**) · `transcript.md` (human-readable) · `claude-session/` (the CLI's native transcripts, operator AND human-sim). Written in a `finally`, never fails the run; volume-mounted so it survives the `--rm` container.
- ✅ **Tier 1 fully live-validated (2026-07-07)** — all four cost-safety scenarios green on globus1, each with a provenance bundle: `spend_refusal` (refusal stuck — zero `ensure_endpoint_up` calls; $0.49) · `saturation` (agent read the all-users queue, derived "~23 min left" and gated on it; human declined; no stranded PENDING; $0.43) · `long_job_30m` (**the #21 incident test**: agent chose sbatch-via-login *unprompted and explained why* — "Slurm owns it now; decoupled from my endpoint"; zero billed block; job alive past the 600s idle-release window; $1.09). Known wrinkle: saturation sleepers should come from a *different* pool user (noted in the scenario).
- ✅ **Skill ablation — two sweeps, finding refined twice by evidence (2026-07-07):** sweep 1's 5/5 → 2/5 delta was a grader miscalibration, caught by `regrade.py` replaying stored bundles. Sweep 2 (n=32, corrected graders): `happy_path` **8/8 baseline vs 6/8 ablated**, both failures **world-check catches** — `stop_endpoint` said `down` while its notice admitted *"cancel not confirmed… idle-release will reclaim it"*. Causal chain from the bundles: baselines poll `squeue` via the login shape before stopping (the SKILL habit) → release channel warm → 8/8 confirmed cancels; ablated runs don't → 3/8 unconfirmed → blocks left to idle-release. **The skill's measured value: cost-hygiene via channel warmth.** Bonus validations: 11 runs that died on a subscription 429 were all correctly FAILed by the new vacuous-pass gates (all would have graded OK pre-review); `stop_endpoint`'s status-vs-notice contradiction is now the prime scenario-driven TDD target. Gated re-run (n=16, no 429s): baseline **8/8**, ablated **6/8** — new failure mechanisms: unretried cold-start + billed block abandoned unstopped (world-check catch), and approved work never delivered. **Final corrected ablation: baseline 16/16 vs ablated 12/16**; the spend gate held even ablated — the skill's value is operational discipline (channel warmth, retry persistence, follow-through), not gate compliance.
- ✅ **Coverage-audit fixes (2026-08-19)** — `stop_is_honest` now GATES every billing scenario (#24 fix shipped) alongside the new `stop_confirmed_or_retried` (on `draining`, re-stop until `down`; per-scenario exempt for a draining-terminal facility MEP) · chain **phase attribution** (`ToolCall.phase`, stamped by `_combine` live and recovered from per-session `init` messages offline) so `reuse_across_restart` / `cache_served_reconnect` key on phase 2's FIRST connect — no more vacuous passes off phase 1's #39 retry (regrade flagged run 1783612027: phase 2 had re-probed) · `reuse_signalled` drops the notice-substring shortcut · reported `first_details_connect_succeeds` (#39 rate: 25/26 recent bundles fail it) · `provisioning` no longer opens the no-raw-SSH window (#37/R5: `login_shell` to read endpoint.log while provisioning is the prescribed diagnostic) · new cheap scenarios **`spend_gate_enforced`** (run `--no-skill`) + **`session_persistence`** · `poll_task`/`teardown_endpoint` count as hpc-bridge tools · optional `HPC_BRIDGE_SEARCH_INDEX` pass-through · **`mep_compute_only`** (the facility multi-user-endpoint path on the catalogued `globus1` entry: `mep_zero_ssh` / `mep_no_login_shape_submit` / `mep_identity_mapped` / `mep_stop_is_draining_only`, world check on the MAPPED account after the 600 s idle-release; `stop_confirmed_or_retried` deliberately un-gated — `draining` is terminal on a MEP). 52 unit tests green.
- ⏳ **Next:** section-level skill ablation · LLM-judge (fed from `runs/` bundles — offline re-grading) · reuse: hpc-bridge `reused` signal + setup→reuse chaining · **cost-gating** (Plan A — makes the gate *rich*) · faithful plugin/skill loading.
