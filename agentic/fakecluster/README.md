# agentic/fakecluster — a Docker-simulated Slurm cluster for hpc-bridge live testing

A local, deterministic Slurm cluster (`docker compose`) that stands in for **globus1** when the lab
cluster is contended: a real `slurmctld` + `slurmdbd` (MariaDB — so `sacct`/`sacctmgr` work), two
compute nodes, and a **login node running sshd** with the harness's pool users, all sharing `/home`.
hpc-bridge's real SSH bootstrap runs against it unchanged: the discover-first probe proposes the
right config, a personal Globus Compute endpoint self-provisions into a `uv` venv on the login node,
and a `SlurmProvider` block is `sbatch`'d onto a compute container whose worker phones home over the
compose network. Outbound HTTPS/AMQPS to Globus works from every container (Docker NAT).

**It complements globus1; it does not replace it.** No module system, no MFA, no site Slurm quirks,
no accounting enforcement, no GPUs, no facility MEP (see *Limitations*). What it gives you is a
cluster you can saturate, kill blocks on, and reset in seconds — and run regressions on when globus1
is busy.

Status: **spike (2026-09-03) — all three steps proven**, including a full hpc-bridge bootstrap →
compute block → `run_shell` → teardown in 96 s (see *Stretch result*). Wired into the harness as `--target fake` (see *Running the agentic harness against it*).

```

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (Apple silicon is the tested host; images are **arm64-native** — Ubuntu 24.04 ships
  `slurm-wlm` 23.11 + `munge` for arm64, so there's no x86 emulation). ~2 GB of images.
- Nothing else. The test SSH key is generated for you **outside the repo** (`~/.ssh/hpcb-fake`).
- For the stretch driver only: a logged-in Globus Compute `~/.globus_compute/storage.db` on the host
  and the agentic jail image (`hpc-bridge-agentic`, built by `agentic/run_smoke.sh`).

## Quickstart (all commands from the repo root)

```bash
# 1. Build + start + wait until schedulable (first build ~3 min; later starts ~20 s).
agentic/fakecluster/bin/up.sh
#    → generates ~/.ssh/hpcb-fake if missing, `docker compose up -d --build`, then waits for
#      2 idle nodes in `main`, `sacct`, and sshd accepting the key. Ends with "READY".

# 2. Step-1 proof: sbatch over ssh as a pool user → COMPLETED on a compute container in sacct.
agentic/fakecluster/bin/prove-sbatch.sh
#    PROOF OK: job 1 COMPLETED on c1

# 3. Step-2 sweep: tools, NIC, outbound HTTPS/AMQPS, srun-in-a-job, shared /home, uv provisioning.
agentic/fakecluster/bin/check-login.sh

# 4. (Stretch) hpc-bridge's REAL bootstrap → login shape → compute block → run_shell → teardown,
#    driven from inside the agentic jail image joined to the cluster network.
agentic/fakecluster/bin/stretch.sh

# Poke at it by hand:
ssh -p 2222 -i ~/.ssh/hpcb-fake -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null \
    hpcbridge-test-00@localhost 'sinfo; squeue; sacct -X'
docker compose -f agentic/fakecluster/docker-compose.yml logs -f slurmctld c1 c2 login

# Stop (keeps volumes: homes, accounting DB, munge key) / wipe everything.
agentic/fakecluster/bin/down.sh
agentic/fakecluster/bin/down.sh --wipe
```

The manual step-1 proof from the spike brief, verbatim, also works:
```bash
ssh -p 2222 -i ~/.ssh/hpcb-fake hpcbridge-test-00@localhost \
  'sbatch --wrap "hostname; sleep 5" -p main -N1 && sleep 8 && sacct -X -o JobID,State,NodeList'
```

Knobs (env): `HPCB_FAKE_SSH_PORT` (default 2222), `HPCB_FAKE_KEY` (default `~/.ssh/hpcb-fake`),
`HPCB_FAKE_USER` (default `hpcbridge-test-00`), `SLURM_DB_PASS` (the throwaway MariaDB password —
a local fixture inside the private network, not a secret).

## What's in the cluster

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| Slurm | 23.11.4 (Ubuntu 24.04 `slurm-wlm`), munge auth, `slurmdbd` + MariaDB 11 accounting |
| Cluster / partition | `ClusterName=fake`, one partition **`main`** (default), `MaxTime=2-00:00:00` |
| Nodes | `c1`, `c2` — `CPUs=4 RealMemory=4000` (declared; `config_overrides` so slurmd doesn't argue with the VM's real 18 cores) |
| Login node | service/hostname `login`, sshd on container port 22 → host **2222**; `hostname -f` = `login` (single-label ⇒ hpc-bridge keeps the alias, no node pin) |
| Users | `hpcbridge-test` (uid 1999) + **`hpcbridge-test-00..09`** (uids 2000–2009), group `hpcb` (2000); same on every node; key-only ssh; no password |
| Shared FS | named volume `home` mounted at **`/home`** on `login`, `c1`, `c2` (the endpoint venv `~/hpc-bridge/gce-venv`, `~/.globus_compute`, and the session scratch `~/.hpc-bridge` are all visible to workers) |
| Accounting | cluster `fake` registered; account `hpcb` with all pool users; **no enforcement** (`--account` not required — like globus1's `AccountingStorageEnforce=none`) |
| Toolchain on every node | Python **3.12.3**, **uv**, `bash base64 scancel squeue sacct sinfo sacctmgr sbatch srun ip curl git`, build-essential |
| NIC | **`eth0`** (the only non-lo interface — `address_by_interface: eth0`) |
| Network | outbound HTTPS + AMQPS 443 to Globus OK; nothing published but the ssh port |

### hpc-bridge facility config

This is what hpc-bridge's discovery probe proposes for it (verified live — you can pass it as
`connect_facility(details=…)` verbatim, or just use `connect_facility(facility="fake", ssh_host=…)`):

```yaml
ssh_host: login            # `hpcb-fake` from the host via the ssh alias; `login` from a container on the network
interface: eth0
env_setup: "[ -d {venv} ] || uv venv {venv}; . {venv}/bin/activate; command -v globus-compute-endpoint >/dev/null 2>&1 || uv pip install -q globus-compute-endpoint"
scratch_root: /home/{user}/.hpc-bridge
partition: main
scheduler: slurm
walltime: "00:30:00"
```

Two ways to reach the login node:

- **From the host** (an interactive Claude Code session, `uv run hpc-bridge`): append
  `ssh_config.example` to `~/.ssh/config` (alias `hpcb-fake` → `localhost:2222`, user
  `hpcbridge-test-00`, the test key, host-key pinning off), then `HPC_BRIDGE_SSH_HOST=hpcb-fake`. hpc-bridge's `SshTarget` has no port field — the alias is what carries the port.
- **From a container** (the agentic jail, the stretch driver): join the network
  (`docker run --network hpcb-fake_default …`) and use `HPC_BRIDGE_SSH_HOST=login` on port 22 — no
  alias, no port mapping. This is how `bin/stretch.sh` does it.

## Profiles — one image, many cluster shapes

A **profile** is a directory under `profiles/<name>/`: `profile.toml` (a manifest whose `[capabilities]` describe the
cluster in the vocabulary scenarios use), `slurm.conf`, optional `gres.conf`, `job_submit.lua`, a
`compose.override.yml` overlay (extra nodes, networks, login nodes) and `setup.d/<role>.sh` fixtures run by that
role's entrypoint (e.g. a fake `mybalance`, QOS/accounts). The profile dir is mounted at `/etc/hpcb/profile` and
applied at container start, so switching shape is `down.sh --wipe && up.sh --profile <name>` (~20 s once built).

| profile | what it is | for |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | 2 nodes, one partition `main`, no enforcement, one login node, one NIC | the spike's cluster; every SSH scenario |
| `site` | 3 nodes; `debug` (30 min, QOS cap) / `compute` (default) / `gpu` (c3, `hpcb-gpu` only, must request a GPU — `job_submit.lua`); accounting ENFORCED (wrong account rejected); fake `mybalance` on PATH; two NICs; **two login nodes behind the round-robin name `login`** (`login01.hpcb.test`:2222, `login02.hpcb.test`:2223, shared host keys like a real site) | discovery with real choices; the spend gate as a decision; balance parsers end to end; the login-node PIN class |
| `mep` | `site` + a **facility multi-user endpoint** (Globus Compute MEP) run as root in login01 — TWO managers, `hpcb-mep-strict` (schema `additionalProperties:false`, no compute/interface/worker_init keys: Anvil's shape) and `hpcb-mep-open` (globus1's shape); the harness' test identity maps to the local account `hpcbmep`; a second identity is unmapped (NO ACCOUNT). Needs the MEP owner's Globus login (`HPCB_MEP_GLOBUS_DB`, defaults to `HPCB_TEST_GLOBUS_DB` from `agentic/.env`) and installs `globus-compute-endpoint==<the plugin's SDK version>` at first boot (~1–2 min; the managed python lives under `/opt/uv-python` so the mapped user can exec it — uv's default `/root/.local` store made the user endpoint die with EX_NOPERM); `HPCB_MEP_EMAIL` (REQUIRED, a real address — it is registered with Globus as the managers' contact; without it the managers are not started) | the zero-SSH path: attach, identity mapping, the strict template contract, draining-only stop, NO ACCOUNT |
| `totp` | `site` whose login sshd demands the key **and a one-time code** (PAM google-authenticator, `AuthenticationMethods publickey,keyboard-interactive:pam`) — the Expanse/TACC shape. Every pool user is enrolled with ONE shared secret (generated on first use into the gitignored `agentic/fakecluster/.totp-secret` — `[totp] secret_file`; the sshd is local-only) that the harness' human-sim also holds, so it answers the agent's code request like a person reading their phone. A second, key-only sshd on **:2200** is the harness' world channel (the published host ports map there; `HPCB_HARNESS_SSH_PORT` inside the jail) | the in-session one-time-code handoff: `needs_preauth` → `complete_preauth` → the master; never a password |
| `pbs` | an **OpenPBS** cluster on its own image and compose stack (`Dockerfile.pbs` builds OpenPBS 23.06 from source for arm64 on Ubuntu 22.04; `docker-compose.pbs.yml`: `pbsserver` + moms `c1`,`c2` + `login`). Queues `workq` (default, 48 h) and `debug` (30-min cap); no allocation enforcement; nodes report `ncpus=4`; jobs get a real PATH (`pbs_environment` — OpenPBS's default `/bin:/usr/bin` hid `uv` from the plugin's worker_init and the pilot exited 127). The harness' world channel switches to `qstat`/`qdel` and the node gate to `pbsnodes` from the profile's `scheduler` capability | the plugin's PBS path end to end — `qstat -Q` discovery, `PBSProProvider` blocks (`select`, `-q`, `-A`), `qstat -x -f -F json` polling, the `qstat -f` pilot probe, `qdel` release — which had only ever met Aurora (blocked on allocation) |
| `lmod` | `site` whose toolchain comes through **Lmod**: `uv` is moved off the default PATH and served as `module load uv/0.12.9`, a module-served CPython as `python/3.11` (plus a decoy `gcc/13.2`); Lmod is in the image but its `/etc/profile.d` hooks are parked until this profile restores them, so no other profile grows a `module` command | module-aware discovery (0.1.10): the proposal must be `module load …`, not a curl-installed uv, and must re-initialise `module` for the compute node's batch shell |
| `f2b` | `site` whose login sshd is watched by **fail2ban** (globus1's shape, tightened: maxretry 3, findtime 10 min, ban 10 min, `iptables-multiport` on port 22 — the containers get `NET_ADMIN`); sshd logs auth to a file for it; a key-only harness sshd on **:2200** stays outside the jail; pool users may `sudo fail2ban-client` (CLEANUP unbans between cells) | a refused key is explained once and never retried into a ban; a BANNED client gets `CANNOT REACH`, relayed once; the world check reads fail2ban's log on every login node |
| `polaris` | the `pbs` cluster with ALCF Polaris's rule: `filesystems` is a real PBS host-level resource (nodes offer home, eagle, grand; the scheduler knows it) and a **queuejob hook HOLDS** any job that does not request `-l filesystems=…`, writing the reason into the job's comment | the plugin's HELD-pilot path: the probe must surface the hold **with the site's comment** (0.1.11) and the agent must add the directive through `scheduler_options` or relay the rule — never poll a held pilot forever |
| `internal` | `site` whose login nodes call themselves by **internal names** (`hostname -f` = `login0N.int.hpcb.test`, aliased only on the internal `data` network — cluster nodes resolve it, the jail cannot); the public names still resolve | the login-node PIN when the node's own name is useless to the client: later SSH must still reach the node the manager landed on (pin by the address actually reached, 0.1.12), and teardown must leave both nodes clean |

Scenarios declare what they need — `REQUIRES = {"login_nodes": 2}`, `{"accounting": "enforce"}`, `{"min_nodes": 3}`,
`{"scheduler": "pbs"}` … — and `run_suite` skips a cell the target/profile cannot satisfy (`targets.meets`). Bundles
record `config.profile` and `config.capabilities`. Postchecks may say `"on": "each_login"` to run on every login node.

## Running the agentic harness against it (`--target fake`)

The harness knows two targets (`agentic/harness/targets.py`): `globus1` (default) and `fake`. One preset carries the
jail-side ssh host (`login`), the compose network the jail joins, the pool key (`~/.ssh/hpcb-fake`), the endpoint name
prefix (`hpc-bridge-fake-<runid>`, so fake and globus1 endpoints are told apart in the shared Globus identity) and the
node count (2 — `saturation` sizes its sleepers from it). Scenario prompts name the login host as `{ssh_host}`.

```bash
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --target fake --scenarios happy_path,endpoint_reuse --concurrency 3
#   ^ runs bin/up.sh first (build if needed, wait until schedulable + sshd); --reset-cluster wipes it first;
#     --no-cluster-up skips that. The node gate probes `sinfo` through the published sshd as a pool user.
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --target fake --profile site --reset-cluster --scenarios rich_gate,partition_choice,gpu_rule,submit_policy_rejected,login_pin_teardown
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --target fake --profile mep --reset-cluster --scenarios fake_mep_compute,fake_mep_no_account
#   ^ the facility-MEP path against the fake managers (a local catalog names their UUIDs — see below)
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --target fake --profile totp --reset-cluster --scenarios otp_preauth
#   ^ the one-time-code login (needs_preauth → complete_preauth); the human-sim holds the authenticator
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --target fake --profile pbs --reset-cluster --scenarios happy_path,gated_provision
#   ^ the same scenarios on an OpenPBS cluster (a different stack: `compose = "docker-compose.pbs.yml"` in the manifest)
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --target fake --profile lmod --reset-cluster --scenarios lmod_bootstrap
#   ^ a module-system site: discovery proposes `module load`, and the worker's batch shell can replay it
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --target fake --profile f2b --reset-cluster --scenarios f2b_stranger,f2b_banned
#   ^ fail2ban: no retry storm on a refused key (no ban recorded); a pre-banned client is told CANNOT REACH
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --target fake --profile polaris --reset-cluster --scenarios polaris_filesystems
#   ^ a PBS site rule: the pilot is HELD with a comment; the tool relays it; the agent adds -l filesystems=…
python3 agentic/run_suite.py --target fake --profile internal --reset-cluster --scenarios internal_hostnames
#   ^ internal login hostnames: the pin must not use a name the client cannot resolve; both nodes clean after teardown
#   ^ a different cluster shape (see Profiles); switching profiles needs --reset-cluster. These five are the
#     `site`-only scenarios (REQUIRES the profile's capabilities; skipped elsewhere): the RICH gate judged by a
#     budget hawk (parsed balances + a real partition choice reach the spend question), a NON-default partition
#     pick that must reach the scheduler (accounting reads it back), the gpu partition's GPU-request RULE (a
#     rejected block is surfaced by #32's pilot probe and relayed or satisfied, never polled forever), a submit the
#     scheduler REFUSES for a reason the agent cannot see (an association submit limit the ADMIN sets — the #32
#     signal made deterministic), and the round-robin login PIN. gated_provision/happy_path run here too.
#
#   ADMIN CHANNEL: a scenario's ADMIN_SETUP / ADMIN_CLEANUP are cluster-admin commands (sacctmgr limits, scontrol
#   drain…) that run_smoke.sh runs as root on the controller (`docker exec hpcb-fake-slurmctld-1 bash -lc`;
#   HPCB_FAKE_CTLD overrides the container) before the agent starts and — always, via an EXIT trap — after the
#   cell. `{user}` is the cell's pool user. It exists only here: on a real facility we are not the admin, so
#   run_suite skips such cells (the fake tier is where cluster-side world changes are exercised).
#
#   PROFILE INHERITANCE: a profile may declare `base = "<other>"` in its profile.toml and LAYER on it — files merged
#   (the derived profile's win), [capabilities] merged, every compose.override.yml in the chain passed to compose (base
#   first), setup.d scripts from every layer run (setup.d/<role>.sh then setup.d/<role>-*.sh). bin/profile.py builds the
#   merged dir under .merged/<name>/ (gitignored); that is what the containers mount. `mep` = `site` + the MEP overlay.
#
#   LOCAL CATALOG: a profile whose facilities cannot be registry entries (MEP UUIDs minted per cluster) declares
#   `[catalog] cmd` — a host command printing this cluster's seed-format catalog (mep: `hpcb-mep-catalog` in login01,
#   reading each manager's endpoint.json). run_smoke.sh runs it per cell and mounts the output into the jail as
#   HPC_BRIDGE_CATALOG_FILE — the plugin's dev/test seam (0.1.8) that replaces the registry for that process.
#
#   REGISTRATIONS: each manager (and every user endpoint it forks) is a record in the Globus Compute service under the
#   owner identity. A warm restart reuses them (the `mep-state` volume keeps the UUIDs). `down.sh --wipe` runs the
#   profile's deregister.sh FIRST — a one-off container on the mep-state + mep-tools volumes runs
#   `globus-compute-endpoint delete` per manager — so wiping never orphans records (HPCB_FAKE_KEEP_REGISTRATIONS=1 skips).
HPCB_TARGET=fake ./agentic/run_smoke.sh spend_refusal          # one cell
HPCB_TARGET=fake ./agentic/sweep_pool_user.sh hpcbridge-test-00 # hand sweep (rarely needed: --reset-cluster instead)
```

What runs here: every SSH-bootstrap scenario (the block tier's `happy_path`, `gated_provision`, `spend_gate_enforced`,
`long_task_via_handle`, `endpoint_reuse*`, `facility_cache`, `spend_refusal`, `session_persistence`, `byo_teardown_clean`,
`unknown_host_key`, `no_ssh_access` — with no fail2ban to trip). Not here (yet): the facility-MEP pair
(`mep_compute_only`, `stranger_mep_walk`) and the one-time-code path — see *Limitations*. Bundles record
`config.target` and `config.ssh_host`.

Status: **wired 2026-09-05** (`--target fake`); the spike's stretch driver (`bin/stretch.sh`) remains as the
agent-free smoke.

## Chaos recipes (what globus1 can't give you on demand)

```bash
F=agentic/fakecluster/docker-compose.yml
# Saturate the cluster as ANOTHER pool user (the `saturation` scenario's SETUP, without waiting for a real user to do it).
ssh -p 2222 -i ~/.ssh/hpcb-fake hpcbridge-test-01@localhost 'for i in 1 2; do sbatch -p main -N1 --exclusive --wrap "sleep 1800"; done'
# Kill a running block out from under the endpoint (the #21 / poll_task-must-notice case).
docker compose -f $F exec login scancel -u hpcbridge-test-00
# Kill a compute node mid-job (NODE_FAIL), then bring it back.
docker compose -f $F kill c1 && sleep 30 && docker compose -f $F start c1
# Restart the controller (jobs survive via StateSaveLocation).
docker compose -f $F restart slurmctld
# Fresh cluster in ~20 s (also wipes the pool users' homes → no stale endpoints/venvs).
agentic/fakecluster/bin/down.sh --wipe && agentic/fakecluster/bin/up.sh
```

## Limitations (honest list)

- **Not a facility.** No Duo push
  (the `totp` profile covers the one-time-CODE half of `needs_preauth`). The `default` profile also has no `job_submit`
  rules, QOS/limits, accounting enforcement, balances or GPUs — the `site` profile adds all of those (a
  fake `mybalance`, dummy `/dev/nvidia*`), so a scenario that needs them declares `REQUIRES` and runs there.
- **Multi-user endpoint (MEP): covered by the `mep` profile** — two root-run MEPs in login01 (strict + open schema)
  with an identity mapping `<the harness' Globus identity> → hpcbmep`, so the M1/`MEPFacility` path (attach, identity
  mapping, template contract, draining-only stop, NO ACCOUNT) runs here. Not a facility's exact MEP: the template and
  schemas are ours (modelled on globus1's and Anvil's shapes), and consent is never required.
- **Topology:** everything shares one kernel/VM; `hostname -f` is single-label; one NIC (`eth0`);
  `srun`/`slurmstepd` work but with no cgroup confinement (`CgroupPlugin=cgroup/v1` as a no-op —
  Ubuntu's 23.11 build has no `disabled` plugin and cgroup/v2 needs systemd/dbus).
- **Globus is still real.** The endpoint registers with and dispatches through the real Globus
  Compute service (the host's `storage.db` identity), so the cluster is local but the control plane
  isn't: endpoints you create here show up in your Globus account (the drivers tear theirs down).
- **Timing is not globus1's.** Block scheduling is instant (idle nodes, no queue), so "wait for the
  queue" behaviour needs the saturation recipe above to reproduce; cold-start is ~1–2 min (UEP fork
  + Parsl strategy period + worker import), not ARM-DGX-with-NFS timing.
- **Version skew is possible:** the login node installs whatever `globus-compute-endpoint` PyPI
  serves (4.16.0 today) while the jail's SDK is lock-pinned (4.13.0). Pin it in `env_setup` if that
  ever bites (globus1's MEP seed does exactly this).

## Stretch result (2026-09-03) — PASSED, 96 s end to end

`bin/stretch.sh` drove hpc-bridge's own server seams (`_connect_facility` → `_ensure_endpoint_up` →
`_run_shell` → `_stop_endpoint` → `_teardown_endpoint`) from inside the `hpc-bridge-agentic` jail
image on the cluster network, with the host's real Globus identity. Timeline:

| t | step | result |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0 s | `connect_facility("fake", ssh_host="login")` | `proposed_facility_details` — exactly the config above (`eth0`, `main`, uv env_setup, `/home/{user}/.hpc-bridge`) |
| 15.3 s | `connect_facility(details=…)` | `provisioning` on the **first** call (seeded `storage.db`, `uv venv` + `pip install globus-compute-endpoint`, `configure`, `start`) — no #39 registration-lag race here |
| 40.1 s | `ensure_endpoint_up(shape="login")` | `up` — "worker live on login (py3.12.3)" |
| 42.1 s | `run_shell(…, shape="login")` | `login / hpcbridge-test-00 / main* idle 2` |
| 86.5 s | `ensure_endpoint_up(shape="compute", partition="main", confirm_spend=True)` | `up` — "worker live on **c1**"; Slurm job 6 `parsl.GlobusComputeEngine-…block-0` RUNNING on c1 |
| 87.5 s | `run_shell("hostname; …", shape="compute")` | **`c1`**, `SLURM_JOB_ID=6` — the worker on the compute container phoned home to the login node's interchange over `eth0` |
| 89–90 s | two more `run_shell(shape="compute")` | warm hits; session shell persisted `cd /tmp` + `export FOO=bar` across calls |
| 91.5 s | `stop_endpoint` | `down` — "compute block released over AMQP (released 6)" (confirmed, not `draining`) |
| 95.6 s | `teardown_endpoint` | `down` — manager gce-stopped + deleted; `squeue` empty; `sacct` shows job 6 `CANCELLED` after 17 s |

So the whole hpc-bridge SSH-bootstrap path — discovery, credential seeding, self-provisioned
endpoint, login shape, billed compute block on a scheduler, dispatch over AMQP, session shell,
release, teardown — runs against this cluster with **zero product changes**.

## Gotchas hit while building this (so you don't again)

- **slurmd 23.11 initialises the cgroup plugin unconditionally**, and `cgroup/v2` wants a systemd
  dbus scope → `slurmd initialization failed` in a plain container. `CgroupPlugin=disabled` is
  24.05+; on 23.11 pin `cgroup/v1` (its init is a no-op). (`slurm/cgroup.conf`.)
- **`srun` eats stdin.** A script fed to `ssh … bash` over stdin dies silently at the first `srun`
  (it forwards stdin to the task). `srun … </dev/null`.
- **DNS flaps while nodes crash-loop.** `slurmctld: Unable to resolve "c2"` just means the `c2`
  container isn't running (compose DNS only answers for live containers); it stops once slurmd stays up.
- **Locked accounts.** `useradd` without a password leaves `!` in shadow; with `UsePAM no`, sshd
  refuses pubkey login to a locked account. `useradd -p '*'`.
- **Homes on a volume.** `useradd -m` in the Dockerfile is shadowed by the `/home` volume; the login
  entrypoint creates the homes (+ `authorized_keys`) on first boot.
- **Host keys churn** on every image build — the ssh alias disables known_hosts pinning.

## Design notes

- **One image, four roles** (`entrypoint.sh <role>`): the endpoint venv on the shared `/home` has a
  python symlink into the system interpreter, so login and compute must be the *same* image; it also
  guarantees identical `slurm`/`munge`/pool uids everywhere (munge credentials carry uids).
- **The munge key is generated per `up`** by `slurmctld` (1 KiB of urandom into the `munge` volume,
  written atomically); every other role waits for it. Never a real cluster's key; nothing in the repo.
- **`auth/slurm`** (`auth_slurm.so` is in the package) would remove munge entirely — a small
  simplification for the real tier (`AuthType=auth/slurm`, `CredType=cred/slurm`, one `slurm.key`).
- **Nothing secret is committed:** the test key lives in `~/.ssh/`, the Globus `storage.db` is
  mounted from the host at run time, the DB password is a local fixture.
