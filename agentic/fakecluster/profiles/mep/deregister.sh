# Delete the fake cluster's MEP REGISTRATIONS with the Globus Compute service before their state is wiped.
# Run by bin/down.sh --wipe (convention: a profile's deregister.sh runs before `down -v`), or by hand. Works with the
# stack DOWN: a one-off container mounts the `mep-state` volume (each manager's endpoint dir + the owner's login) and
# the `mep-tools` volume (the endpoint venv; installed here if missing) and runs `globus-compute-endpoint delete` per
# manager — the record disappears from the owner's endpoint list instead of orphaning when --wipe mints new UUIDs.
# HPCB_FAKE_KEEP_REGISTRATIONS=1 skips it.
