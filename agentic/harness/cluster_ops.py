"""Pure builders for the harness' cluster-side commands (SETUP/teardown/log capture).

Everything here is a string — no SSH, no SDK — so it is unit-testable and so the ONE rule this
module enforces is auditable: **the harness never touches jobs or endpoints that aren't this
run's.** Teardown used to `scancel -u $(whoami)` and delete every `hpc-bridge-*` endpoint the pool
user owned, on the assumption that concurrent runs use distinct users. That assumption broke
(see pool.py) and one run's teardown killed another's blocks mid-task. Now:

- endpoints are stopped/deleted BY NAME — this run's `HPC_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT_NAME` only;
- pilot blocks are cancelled by the `uep.<eid>` StdOut marker Parsl writes under the UEP dir —
  the same scope the server's `_release_cmd` uses — for this run's endpoint uuid(s) only;
- with NO endpoint uuid known, cancel NOTHING (and say so) rather than fall back to user-wide.
