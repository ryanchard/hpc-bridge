"""Per-scenario runner: drive a headless agent over hpc-bridge, capture the Trace.

Registers the hpc-bridge MCP stdio server via the Agent SDK under the key
``endpoint`` (tools surface as ``mcp__endpoint__*``, matching the .mcp.json rename),
injecting **scoped** test credentials via the server's own ``env`` — never the admin
key. Runs the scripted prompt non-interactively (``bypassPermissions`` — the
disposable container IS the sandbox), then returns the normalised Trace + the
ResultMessage for grading by ``invariants.py`` (+ the judge).

Credentials come from THIS process's environment, which in the container holds only
the scoped test key + test Globus identity. See Plan B (runtime sandbox).

Requires ``claude-agent-sdk`` (not a hpc-bridge dependency — installed only in the
agentic harness image). The hermetic ``pytest -q`` never imports this module
(testpaths = ["tests"]).
