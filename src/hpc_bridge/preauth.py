"""In-session one-time code for an MFA facility (2026-09-04).

A facility that demands a TOTP / Duo passcode at every SSH login (SDSC Expanse, TACC) used to need the
user's own terminal: hpc-bridge handed over an `ssh -fN …` line and waited. This module lets the agent
ask the user for the CURRENT code instead and open the shared ControlMaster itself — the same trade the
Globus paste-mode login already makes: a one-time code is single-use and expires in seconds, so a
transcript that holds it leaks nothing reusable. **A password is not a code** and never enters the
session: the askpass helper refuses any prompt that mentions a password, and the code is shape-checked.

Mechanism: OpenSSH calls `$SSH_ASKPASS` for every keyboard-interactive prompt when it has no terminal
(`SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE=force`, OpenSSH >= 8.4). Our helper answers a code-looking prompt with the code read
from a 0600 file, and exits non-zero on a password prompt. The code is never placed in argv or logs.
