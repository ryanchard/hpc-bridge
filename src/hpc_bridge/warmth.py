"""The warmth state machine and task-handle bookkeeping (split steps 7–8, 2026-09-03).

Per resource shape: build/reuse the Executor (`_runner_for`), prove a worker is live with the canary
(`_confirm_worker`), gate a billed block behind the spend floor (`_provision`, `_apply_partition`,
`_apply_account`), record the sticky no-account verdict and the transient-conflict count, and drop
shapes (`_drop_compute_shape`, `_drop_all_shapes`, `_forget_identity_verdicts`). Task handles — a command
still running past the sync-wait — are registered, resolved and drained here too, because the runner
rebuild and the canary consult them (a live task IS warmth), which is why steps 7 and 8 ship together.

Every function here runs under `app.lock`, held by the caller in `server`. Tests patch
`warmth._provision` / `warmth._drop_compute_shape`; `server` calls those two through the module and
re-exports every name for imports.
