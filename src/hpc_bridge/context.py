"""The server's runtime state (split step 1, 2026-09-03): data plus the three derived reads on it
(`_supported_shapes`, `_has_login_shape`, `_idle_release_s`).

`AppCtx` is the one object every tool call shares (installed by the server's lifespan); a `ShapeRuntime`
per resource shape carries that shape's Executor, warmth/canary state and spend clock; a `TaskHandle`
is a dispatched command still running past the sync-wait. The behaviour that mutates these lives in
`server.py` (and, as the split proceeds, in the modules it delegates to); `server` re-exports these
names, so `from hpc_bridge.server import AppCtx` keeps working.
