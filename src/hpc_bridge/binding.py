"""Binding a machine: build the Facility for a catalog entry, the runtime catalog (the public registry),
the session/BYO helpers and the local stores (split step 5, 2026-09-03).

Everything here answers "how do we reach this facility": the SSH facility (login name from ~/.ssh/config,
key, ControlMaster, login-node pin) or the facility-run multi-user endpoint; the registry client
(anonymous unless a Search-scoped login exists); the session endpoint name; the facilities.json store.
The orchestration that USES a bound facility (connect, provision, run, stop) stays in `server`.

Tests patch names on THIS module (`binding.make_catalog`, `binding._facility_from_entry`,
`binding._make_search_client`, `binding._ssh_config_user`) and `config._control_settings`; callers
everywhere go through the owning module's attribute so a patch reaches them.
