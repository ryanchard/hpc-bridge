"""Agent-facing wording: every pure notice/outcome builder (split step 3, 2026-09-03).

A notice is the product — the agent reads it and acts — so the words live in one module: the
first-contact explanations (NO SSH ACCESS / CANNOT REACH / REMOTE FILESYSTEM), the spend floor, the
warm-block bounds, the login instructions, the terminal refusals (NO ACCOUNT, NO LONGER transient),
and the ShellOutcome/ConnectFacilityResult/LoginStatus factories. No I/O, no state mutation: these
functions read the context and return text or a result model. `server` re-exports them.
