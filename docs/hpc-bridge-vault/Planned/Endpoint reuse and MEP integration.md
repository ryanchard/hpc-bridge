# Endpoint reuse and MEP integration

> [!abstract] In one line
> The zero-SSH ladder: first **surface the reuse hpc-bridge already does silently** for endpoints it stood up, then **consume facility-run multi-user MEPs** so the facility's identity mapping replaces our SSH bootstrap outright — shrinking SSH from "every cold start" toward "never." **Phase 1 (reuse our own) has SHIPPED; Phase 2 (facility MEPs) is now the V1-gating objective** (user, 2026-07-20) — and it doubles as the graceful browser-auth story: a Globus consent replaces the SSH/MFA prompt entirely.

## The reuse ladder

Three ways to reach a warm compute channel, best-first — each removes more SSH:

| Tier | Mechanism | SSH cost | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. **Facility MEP** | submit a UEP config to a facility's multi-user (identity-mapped) manager UUID | **none, ever** | Phase 2 (this note) |
| 2. **Our online endpoint** | reattach to an already-running `hpc-bridge-<facility>` by name | none after the first bootstrap | **Phase 1 — SHIPPED** ([#20](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/20)): signal surfaced + inter-agent chain test |
| 3. **SSH bootstrap** | SSH in once, start our own personal manager | one bootstrap (~2 auths) | built — the current default |

## Two senses of "MEP" — don't conflate them

[[MEP & templated endpoints]]: hpc-bridge's endpoint *is already* a Globus v4 MEP — but in **personal / single-user mode** (`configure --multi-user false`, `endpoint.py:58`), where "multi-user" names only the **manager + templated-UEP** architecture, not identity mapping. We own that manager; it serves one user.

A **facility MEP** (Phase 2) is the *other* sense: a manager the **facility** runs in **true multi-user mode with identity mapping** — one daemon serving many users, forking an identity-mapped UEP per authenticated Globus identity. **That identity mapping is precisely what replaces our SSH bootstrap:** SSH exists today only to authenticate-as-the-user and start their personal manager; a facility MEP already runs the manager and maps our Globus identity to a local account over AMQP, so no SSH is needed. Tier 1 is not "reuse our endpoint" — it's "borrow the facility's."

## Phase 1 — reuse hpc-bridge's own endpoints ✅ SHIPPED ([#20](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/20), PR #26)

**The detection already existed and works cross-session.** `bootstrap()` (`facility/remote.py:544`) asks Globus, *before any SSH*, whether we already own an online endpoint by the stable name `hpc-bridge-<facility>`:

```python
reused = await self.find_online_endpoint(self.profile.endpoint_name)   # remote.py:559 / :643
if reused is not None:
    return EndpointHandle(endpoint_id=reused, ...)                      # zero SSH, over AMQP
```

Because the name is stable and the manager persists on the cluster, a **fresh server process reconnects to a prior session's endpoint with zero SSH** — the SSH-once story is real *today* ([[Standing up the endpoint]]).

**The gap was the signal, not the logic — now closed.** The reuse fact was computed into `reused` and then dropped (`EndpointHandle` carried no flag), so the connect result never learned it happened. #20 threaded it up: `EndpointHandle.reused` (set at `bootstrap()` `:561` and `provision()`'s `running` case `:593`, false on a fresh `start`) → `EndpointState.reused` → `ConnectFacilityResult.reused` + a "zero-SSH reconnect" notice. The agent and user can now tell "reattached, free" from "freshly bootstrapped."

**Verified two ways** (both scenarios green): `endpoint_reuse` (intra-agent — one session, two connects) live, and `endpoint_reuse_chain` (inter-agent — two agent sessions across an MCP-server restart, the true cross-session case) via re-grade of the real trace. The harness gained a `PHASES` chain primitive to run the latter (see [[Agentic testing - Plan B (runtime sandbox)]]).

> [!note] Resolved ([#37](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/37) / [PR #38](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/pull/38)): stale-online reuse
> Reuse **deliberately gates on `manager_online` alone — no liveness probe**: a probe can't distinguish a dead ghost from a cold-starting fresh worker, so a canary-gate *on reuse* false-rejects a healthy fresh endpoint (it was tried, then removed). A genuinely dead "online" ghost is instead handled gracefully **downstream** — the robust [[Warmth, the canary & cold-start|canary]] maps its shut-down Executor to not-warm → `provisioning`, which the agent recovers via `teardown_endpoint` + reconnect. And `provision` clears stale per-UEP `daemon.pid` files at start (the exit-73 fix). Re-bootstrap-on-stale was **rejected** — a compute-first re-bootstrap can't tell a ghost from a cold start.

## Phase 2 — consume facility MEPs (the V1 objective)

**This is the V1 gate** (2026-07-20): a working zero-SSH MEP path before publishing V1. It is *also* the graceful-auth story — a facility MEP authorizes us by a **Globus consent (a browser OAuth)**, the same loopback + paste-back pattern the [Cloudflare MCP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/) uses (`authenticate` → auth URL → approve in browser → return to session). There is no SSH and no Duo to hand off. The two Globus-SDK unknowns that used to size this are now **verified against `globus_compute_sdk` 4.13.0** (inline below).

> [!success] M1 target acquired — `globus-cluster-mep` is live on globus1 (2026-08-18)
> The globus-cluster admin agent stood up a true multi-user, identity-mapped MEP and verified it end-to-end (dispatch → mapped to `glabs` → Slurm job on `main`). **UUID `da3df250-4013-4d69-942c-eef1568f860c`** → the `compute_mep_uuid` for a globus1 catalog entry. Full spec + gotchas: [[globus-cluster-mep-testbed]] (memory) · cluster vault Reference/08c + D-034. Three findings shape M1:
> 1. **Consent-free here.** The Bearer token flowed straight through to submission validation — no consent-required 401. So **globus1 cannot exercise M2's `needs_consent` flow**; on this facility **M1 alone is the complete zero-SSH path**. M2 still stands for facilities that *do* gate on consent — it just needs a different testbed to validate.
> 2. **The login shape (`compute:false` / `LocalProvider`) is REJECTED by the MEP schema.** Forked user endpoints run in `system.slice` with no memory cgroup, so an unbounded LocalProvider task on globus1 (which is *also* the Slurm controller + NFS server) is refused outright — not silently rerouted. ⟹ **`MEPFacility` is compute-only**: no free login-node exec; map any "login" op to a warm Slurm block (`init_blocks: 1` + short walltime keeps it warm for `max_idletime`=600 s, so only the first call pays the queue). This **reinforces** the draining-only stop below — one shape, one channel.
> 3. **Version pin is the client's job.** Endpoint + workers must match; theirs is `globus-compute-endpoint==4.15.0`. The catalog entry's `env_setup` → `worker_init` must install it **unconditionally** — a `command -v … || install` guard silently keeps a wrong-version venv → cryptic `process_worker_pool.py: -P/--port` job failures. Account is **not required** (`AccountingStorageEnforce=none`); pass `""` and it's stripped.

**The dispatch half is nearly built.** A Globus Compute run is already `Executor(endpoint_id, user_endpoint_config)` (`runner.py:96`) — literally what a facility MEP consumes — and the `HPC_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT_ID=<uuid>` BYO hatch (`server.py:308` `_env_endpoint_id`) already dispatches to a foreign UUID with **zero provisioning**. What's missing is everything around *choosing* and *configuring* that UUID as a first-class, discovered path.

**The information we'd need to gather** (the open question the user flagged — settle this before building):
1. **The MEP UUID, per facility** — the catalog field **already exists**: `CatalogEntry.compute_mep_uuid` (`catalog/entry.py:73`, UUID-validated). Today `_unsupported_entry_reason` (`server.py:171`) *rejects* such an entry (*"catalog-driven MEP dispatch is not wired yet — use HPC_BRIDGE_ENDPOINT_ID"*); wiring Phase 2 = replacing that reject with a MEP branch. Discovery of the UUID (a facility that *publishes* a MEP) layers on [[Discovery channel model]] / [[Globus index discovery channel]] / the ACCESS survey ([#7](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/7)).
2. **The allowed `user_endpoint_config`** — the facility owns the `user_config_template.yaml.j2` + its `user_config_schema`; we fill *its* variables (account / partition / walltime / nodes), never an arbitrary template. **Verified (SDK 4.13.0):** there is **no first-class schema fetch** — `Client.get_endpoint_metadata(uuid)` returns config *values* (best-effort), not a structured `user_config_schema`. But the web service **validates `user_endpoint_config` server-side at submit** — a bad key/value is rejected regardless — so the schema is a *UX nicety* (offer the right partitions up front), not a correctness gate. → **curate the allowed config in the entry; treat `get_endpoint_metadata` as opportunistic; rely on server-side validation as the safety net.**
3. **Consent — the graceful browser auth.** A Globus Auth consent for the MEP's scope is the irreducible "access" input. It is a **browser OAuth** (authorize URL → approve → return), the *same* UX as the Cloudflare MCP's `authenticate`/`complete_authentication` (loopback + paste-back fallback). Surface it as a new `connect_facility` phase `needs_consent` carrying the authorize URL; reuse the scope machinery (`credentials._missing_scopes` / `login_required`). This is "graceful auth that returns to the terminal," on our real credential — and it *replaces* the SSH bootstrap + storage.db seeding wholesale for MEP facilities.
4. **Identity mapping** — confirm the facility maps our Globus identity to the intended local account (the SSH replacement); surface a clear failure if it doesn't, rather than a silent wrong-user run.

**Where it touches the code:**
- A third `Facility` — **`MEPFacility`** (alongside `SlurmFacility` / `LocalFacility`, the [[facility-base|`Facility` protocol]]) — whose `provision()` does **no SSH**: it returns `EndpointHandle(endpoint_id=compute_mep_uuid, reused=True)` after the consent check; `manager_online` is the web check on the UUID; no `bootstrap`, no `config_template` (the *facility* owns the template).
- `connect_facility` / `ensure_endpoint_up` gain a **MEP branch**: a `compute_mep_uuid` entry builds a `MEPFacility` (replacing the `_unsupported_entry_reason` reject); "provision the compute shape" becomes "submit the UEP config to the MEP." The runner binding — `Executor(uuid, uec)` — is unchanged.

> [!warning] Stop/spend does NOT carry over — the honesty guarantee weakens, honestly
> On our personal endpoint, `stop_endpoint` `scancel`s the block over the login shape ([[Cost control]], the `stop_is_honest` fix [#24](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/24)). On a facility MEP **we own neither the manager nor a login channel** — that scancel path doesn't exist. **Verified (SDK 4.13.0): there is no honest foreign-endpoint cancel** — `ComputeFuture.cancel()` only works *pre-run* (a still-queued task), and `Client.stop_endpoint` / `delete_endpoint` act on **our own** registration (calling them on a facility MEP is wrong/unauthorized). So MEP `stop_endpoint` is **`draining`-only** — stop submitting, rely on the MEP's `max_idletime` idle-release — and must **never report `status="down"`** (it can't confirm the block is gone). `teardown_endpoint` is a **no-op** (nothing of ours to destroy). This satisfies `stop_is_honest` by reporting `draining`, not by lying `down`.

**Feasibility to settle first:** which target facilities actually run a *targetable* multi-user MEP? NERSC runs a Globus Compute MEP; does our ACCESS target (Anvil) expose one, or is it SSH-bootstrap-only? Can we submit our own `user_endpoint_config`, or only select a named site preset? These answers size Phase 2.

## Phase 2 milestones (build order)

| M | Deliverable | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| **M1** | **CODE BUILT** (branch `feat/mep-m1`, 2026-08-19): model tweaks (`ssh_host` optional, `init_blocks`, `account_required`, the `_reachable` + no-client-templating validators) · `MEPFacility` (compute-only, `supported_shapes=("compute",)`) · `_facility_from_entry` dispatches on `compute_mep_uuid` first · `_shape_reject` at every shape entry point · `_connect_mep` (attach, no block, MEP-specific `needs_account`) · `_stop_mep` draining-only + teardown-as-detach (**M4 folded in**) · the `globus-cluster.yaml` seed + skill/command guidance. **Remaining:** ingest the seed into the Search index (curator runs `hpc-bridge-catalog`) + the live `mep_compute_only` agentic scenario | catalog-driven MEP dispatch — **target live** (see the M1-target callout above) |
| **M2** | `needs_consent` phase + the browser-OAuth (Globus consent) flow | **the graceful-auth win** — zero SSH, zero Duo. NB: globus1 is consent-free, so validate against a **consent-gating** facility |
| **M3** | Curate the allowed `user_endpoint_config` in the entry; best-effort `get_endpoint_metadata`; lean on server-side validation | correct billed runs |
| **M4** | Honest MEP stop: `draining`-only (idle-release); `teardown` a no-op — **built as part of M1** (`_stop_mep`: draining is FINAL on a MEP, the notice names the idle-release tail and says don't re-poll; teardown detaches) | the semantics gap (no foreign cancel API) |

**M1 + M2 is the V1 story:** a catalogued MEP facility, zero SSH, graceful consent. On the **globus1 testbed specifically, M1 alone** already delivers zero-SSH (it's consent-free); M2 is proven against a consent-gating facility.

## Guiding invariants (must hold across both phases)
- **Hot path stays token/AMQP — no new SSH channel** ([[Two-channel architecture]]). Reuse and MEP consumption *remove* SSH; neither adds a work channel.
- **hpc-bridge still only ever *creates* personal endpoints** — `--multi-user false` stays for anything we stand up ([[MEP & templated endpoints]]). Phase 2 *consumes* a facility MEP; it never makes hpc-bridge run one.
- **Discovery proposes; the user confirms/consents** — a discovered MEP UUID/schema is a session-local candidate, never auto-trusted ([[Discovery channel model]]).
- **Stop stays honest on every channel** ([#24](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/24)).

## Deferred
Identity-mapping edge cases and stale-consent handling; MEP-side allocation/quota reporting — without a login channel there's no `mybalance`, so fall to the account-named spend gate (the `entry.allocation is None` path) unless a facility exposes a balance API.
