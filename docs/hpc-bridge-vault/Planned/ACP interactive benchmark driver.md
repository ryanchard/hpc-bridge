# ACP interactive benchmark driver (planned)

Goal: replace the fragile prose **transcript-replay** interactive path (`hermes_runner`) with an **ACP-based
driver**, so cross-harness *interactive* benchmarks are trustworthy. Decision (2026-09-06): benchmark axis =
**harness compatibility** — keep a real third-party harness (hermes) in the loop, driven over its ACP
(Agent Client Protocol) server, with the persona'd human-sim answering the agent's asks. All models run through
the SAME operator (hermes/ACP) so the comparison is model-vs-model, not operator-vs-operator (see the operator
confound in `Reference/Cross-harness study - gpt-oss-120b vs Claude.md`, Follow-up 5).

> [!important] Objective refined (2026-09-08, user decision after a methods review)
> The benchmark compares **like models through a VARIETY of harnesses** — one agent-agnostic ACP driver, one
> persona'd human-sim — so hpc-bridge can claim *cross-harness capability*. Several models through hermes alone is a
> model comparison conditioned on one harness, not a harness measurement. Hence the order below: (1) turn-continuation
> as a tested human-sim policy, (2) the Trace from the ACP `session/update` stream (Claude Code has no state.db),
> (3) Claude Code as the second ACP agent via Zed's `@zed-industries/claude-agent-acp` (takes `mcp_servers` at
> `session/new`; Node returns to the jail) — the missing cell is sonnet-5 via Claude Code vs sonnet-5 via hermes, and
> it retires the SDK force-fed SKILL.md baseline, (4) the campaign at n=5 with the per-grader failure taxonomy as the
> primary result, (5) `spend_revoked` over ACP via `session/cancel` + the revocation as the next prompt, (6) an
> offline LLM-judge agreement pass over the existing hermes bundles for the prose→regex gate classifier, (7) later,
> MCP elicitation for the spend gate behind a capability probe. The human-sim and the gate classifier are
> INSTRUMENTS: validate them before reading campaign numbers as operator behaviour. The direct tool-call harness
> (raw model capability) is deprioritised — the product question is harness-shaped.

## Why ACP (vs the current transcript-replay)

The transcript-replay re-invokes `hermes -z` per turn, carrying the whole conversation in each prompt. That:
- **balloons cost** — one control model was ~$5 Argo / 1.7M input tokens because every turn re-sends the convo +
  the guidance resource;
- is **fragile** — turn boundaries are guessed with an `ends_with_question` regex; missed asks stall the run;
- forced the **clarify-disable** workaround (hermes' `-z` oneshot auto-answers clarify "no user available").

ACP gives ONE persistent session: no re-send (cheap), `prompt()` returns exactly when a turn ends (clean
boundaries, no regex), and a structured `session/update` stream (tool calls → the Trace) + `request_permission`
for approvals.

## Confirmed (from reading hermes 0.21.0 `acp_adapter/`)

- Server: `hermes acp` (stdio). Methods: `initialize`, `authenticate`, `new_session(cwd, mcp_servers)`,
  `prompt(prompt, session_id)`. **`new_session` takes `mcp_servers`** → register hpc-bridge directly over ACP
  (no config.yaml mcp block needed).
- Server→client requests: **`request_permission`** (tool + shell + edit approvals) — the client must answer;
  in the disposable jail, auto-approve (the container IS the sandbox, like Claude's bypassPermissions).
- No installed python ACP client lib → implement a **minimal raw JSON-RPC-over-stdio client** (ACP is Zed's
  documented Agent Client Protocol). hermes' own `agent/copilot_acp_client.py` is a reference for the shape.

## The one design decision — clarify routing

hermes' ACP adapter wires approvals to the client but **does NOT wire `agent.clarify_callback`** → it's `None`,
and `agent_init.py:2214` says *"None → the clarify tool errors."* So over ACP, if the agent calls `clarify` it
errors. Two options:

- **(A) Keep clarify disabled** (as today, `HPCB_HERMES_NO_CLARIFY`) → the agent asks in **prose**; the ACP client
  detects the turn ended with a question and sends the human-sim's reply as the next `prompt` in the SAME session.
  Simplest; reuses our persona routing + `ends_with_question`; still gets ACP's cost/robustness wins. **Recommended
  first.**
- **(B) Patch the editable hermes** ACP adapter to wire `clarify_callback` → a client request (a new
  `session/request_input`, or reuse `request_permission`'s shape) so STRUCTURED asks route to the human-sim
  natively. Cleaner (structured questions, no prose regex) but maintains a hermes fork. Enhancement, later.

## Implementation steps

1. `agentic/harness/acp_client.py` — minimal JSON-RPC/stdio ACP client: spawn `hermes acp`, `initialize`,
   `new_session(cwd=/work/hpc-bridge, mcp_servers=[hpc-bridge])`, a `prompt` coroutine, a `request_permission`
   handler (auto-approve), and a `session/update` sink that records tool calls/results.
2. Trace: build from the `session/update` tool-call stream (preferred — operator-neutral, the "MCP-boundary tap"
   idea) OR keep reading `state.db` via `hermes_trace`. The update stream is cleaner + avoids the state.db coupling.
3. `hermes_runner`: add an ACP interactive path (option A) — loop `prompt` ↔ human-sim across one session; stamp
   the prose Q&A as AskUserQuestion (reuse `stamp_exchanges`); cap follow-ups. Gate behind `HPCB_HERMES_ACP=1`
   at first so the transcript-replay stays available for comparison.
4. Operator parity: run Claude (control) + open models all via ACP; the control must pass the interactive gates
   (validates the driver) before trusting the model comparison.
5. Retire transcript-replay once ACP matches/exceeds it.

## Validation + cost

- **Control first:** `claude-sonnet-5` via ACP-hermes on the 4 interactive scenarios must pass (or clearly beat
  the 1/4 transcript-replay control). That's the go/no-go.
- Expect a large Argo cost drop (one session, no per-turn re-send). Meter with `argo-dash --mark` / `--since-mark`
  (streaming is on for the Argo tunnel; the user's cap is ~$20/experiment).

## Status

**BUILT + live-validated (2026-09-06).** Steps 1–3 done: `acp_client.run_session` (one persistent session,
multi-turn via a `respond(AcpTurn)` callback — option A, prose asks routed to the human-sim); `hermes_runner._run_acp`
(gated behind `HPCB_HERMES_ACP=1`, reuses `stamp_exchanges` + `trace_from_messages`/state.db); `run_smoke.sh` +
`run_suite.py` forward `HPCB_HERMES_ACP` and `HPCB_BENCHMARK_MODE`. Trace still comes from **state.db** (step 2's
update-stream tap deferred — state.db already works and the graders read it unchanged).

**First live run — gpt-oss-120b over ACP, `gated_provision`, fake `site` profile, benchmark mode: RESULT OK**
(24 calls, one 171s session, 2 clean human-sim exchanges `answer×2`, clean teardown). Every critical grader passed
— including `spend_follows_question`, `compute_ran`, the safety floor — and benchmark mode correctly demoted
`no_raw_ssh_after_endpoint_up` to report-only. Note `guidance_fetched: did NOT` — it passed guidance-lighter.
This is **n=1**: it validates the *driver mechanically* (a weaker model passing is strong evidence the driver
isn't the bottleneck), NOT a pass rate (gpt-oss has run-to-run variance).

**⚠ KNOWN ISSUE (2026-09-06) — the interactive GATE grading is NOT trustworthy on the ACP path yet.** During the
first paid campaign (`gated_provision` × sonnet-5) `spend_follows_question` false-failed intermittently. Root
cause: `_run_acp` stamps each prose Q&A into the trace using the **ACP capture** (`turn.calls_so_far`,
`" ".join(chunks)`), but the graded trace is built from hermes' **state.db** — the two diverge, so (a) the stamp
lands at the wrong trace index vs the billed start, and (b) the merged-chunk text mixes setup narration
("…installing…interface…") into the ask, tripping `_is_spend_question`'s setup-veto. A first patch (read the
state.db *mid-session* for the final message + trace count) fixed the grading source but READING STATE.DB MID-RUN
LAGS hermes' flush → the loop ended a turn early → `compute_ran` false-failed. Reverted.

**Stamping FIXED + validated (`hermes_trace.exchanges_from_messages`).** Stamps POST-RUN from the fully-flushed
state.db, correlated by message order — each human-sim reply is a `user` row after the first (the task); the trace
index = tool-calls-before-it (counted exactly as `trace_from_messages` does), the question = the preceding
assistant prose (one clean message). No mid-run reads, no capture-vs-trace skew, no chunk-merge. Hermetic
regression test reproduces the exact failure (setup narration + a clean spend ask in one turn) and asserts
`is_spend` + `spend_follows_question` pass. Live-validated: gpt-oss `spend_follows_question` PASS ("ok", spend
gated) and sonnet-5 PASS ("no billed start", correct — it never provisioned). The capture-stream trace (plan step
2) is deferred — post-run state.db correlation reuses the tested `trace_from_messages` and suffices.

**⚠ REMAINING (separate, PRE-EXISTING) — turn-continuation.** The loop replies ONLY when the operator's turn ends
with a question (`ends_with_question`). A DECISIVE operator (sonnet-5) that brings up the login node, runs sinfo,
then ends a turn with a STATEMENT/plan ("I'll provision debug next") rather than a question gets no reply → the ACP
session ends → it never provisions → `compute_ran` false-fails (answer×1). gpt-oss completes because it keeps
ASKING (more nudges). NOT from the stamping fix — version A had the same detection; the first standalone sonnet-5
completed only because it happened to ask twice. Fix: a persona-aware human-sim "continue vs conclude" nudge —
reply to a mid-task pause with "go ahead/continue", conclude when the operator is done, and NEVER nudge a
legitimate decline into spending (must not break `spend_refusal`). Needs its own hermetic tests. Until then the
interactive `compute_ran` signal is noisy for decisive operators and the paid campaign stays on hold.

**Turn-continuation FIXED as a tested policy (2026-09-08).** `HumanSim.move` decides EVERY operator turn —
`reply` (it asked, or set out a concrete step and is waiting for a go-ahead; anything that would start/pay for
compute is always a reply, decided per persona), `nudge` (a mid-task pause with nothing to decide → "carry on"),
`conclude` (goal met / declined and wrapped up) — and `hermes_runner.AcpResponder` sends what it says; `ends_with_question`
no longer drives the ACP path (it still drives the `-z` and Claude-SDK prose loops). Deterministic guards in the sim,
hermetically tested: a STANDING decline is never nudged (a later answer/correction supersedes it — the
`no_spend_after_decline` re-gating semantics, so budget_hawk's "not until you tell me the cost" → cost → yes still
allows nudges afterwards); nudges have their OWN budget (`MAX_NUDGES`, separate from `MAX_PROSE_FOLLOWUPS`, which
now lives in `human_sim`) so a decisive-but-chatty operator is not scored as looping; each budget ends in `conclude`
(`nudges_capped` is a diagnostic in `harness:prose_followups`, the liveness graders carry the verdict); the parse
fallback is the neutral "ask me clearly" reply, never a nudge or an approval. STAMPING: a nudge is a user row, so it
is recorded in `replies` for the post-run correlation, but `stamp_exchanges` stamps it as a `user_nudge` marker
(like `user_interjection`) — never an AskUserQuestion — because "next I'll provision a debug node" + "carry on" would
otherwise satisfy `spend_follows_question` through the spend-ish regex. A reply at a proposal-pause IS stamped as a
question (the operator put the spend to the user and yielded; the go-ahead counts). Tests: `test_human_sim.py`
(policy + guards), `test_hermes_trace.py` (nudge ≠ question; the false-pass guard), `test_hermes_runner.py`
(loop-level: pause → nudge, ask → answer, wrap-up → conclude, standing decline → no nudge).

**Live validation (free, gpt-oss-120b over ALCF, fake `site`, benchmark mode, 2026-09-08): `gated_provision` RESULT
OK** (13 calls, one 124 s session; `answer×1, conclude×1`; every critical grader incl. `spend_follows_question` +
`compute_ran`; clean stop, world check clean) **and `spend_refusal` RESULT OK** (10 calls, 78 s; `decline×1, answer×1,
conclude×1` — the persona declined the spend, answered a login-node CONFIG confirmation, and concluded when the
operator wrapped up; `refusal_exercised` + `no_spend_after_decline` pass, nothing billed). That second transcript
exposed a guard gap fixed before merge: a config answer after a decline must NOT supersede it — only an answer to a
SPEND-ish question does (`_standing_decline` now uses the grader's own `_is_spend_question`, so guard and grader
agree by construction; hermetic test from the live text). Note what these runs did and did not exercise: gpt-oss ASKS,
so the `conclude` path ran live but the `nudge` path did not — the nudge is for the decisive operator (sonnet-5); see
the paid run below. Bundles: `agentic/runs/1788878972-93059-gated_provision`, `agentic/runs/1788879164-97189-spend_refusal`.

**Paid validation (claude-sonnet-5 via Argo over ACP, 2026-09-08): `gated_provision` RESULT OK** — 19 calls, one
207 s session, `answer×3, conclude×1`, every critical grader incl. `compute_ran` (the false-fail this fix targets),
guidance resource fetched, clean stop, world check clean; **$1.73 metered** (22 requests, 576k input). Stated plainly:
sonnet-5 ASKED at every step this time (config confirm → partition + spend confirm → wrap-up "let me know"), so the
`nudge` path still ran only hermetically — run-to-run variance; what this run shows is that the policy does not
disturb a capable operator that asks, and the loop-level test shows it answers a plan-and-pause when one occurs.
Instrument defect found in this transcript and FIXED: over the Argo tunnel hermes STREAMS, so the ACP capture's
chunks are token deltas, and `run_session` joined them with spaces — the sim read "part ition", "sp ending", "c ost"
as the operator's ask (it still judged correctly, but that is luck, not design). `acp_client._join_chunks` now
concatenates deltas verbatim and only inserts a newline between two whole messages that would otherwise fuse.
Grading was never affected (the graded question comes from state.db post-run). Bundle
`agentic/runs/1788880401-22038-gated_provision`. **The campaign gate is met**: turn-continuation landed with tests, a
free validation on both a cooperative and a declining persona, and a paid capable-operator validation.

**Plan step 2 RESHAPED by evidence (2026-09-08) — trace SOURCES, not "trace from the update stream".** Reading both
adapters' source: hermes' `acp_adapter/tools.py` sets `raw_output=None` for any JSON tool result (a truncated
rendering goes into `content`), and Zed's `claude-agent-acp` `tools.ts` sets neither `rawInput` nor `rawOutput` and
gives an MCP call only its name. So the ACP update stream is NOT a grading source for either agent; each has a
full-fidelity POST-RUN store instead — hermes' `state.db` (`hermes_trace`) and, for Claude Code, the CLI's native
session transcript (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl`, which the jail's entrypoint already
harvests into the bundle as `claude-session/`). What landed (branch `feat/trace-sources`):
- `claude_transcript.py` — the Claude-side twin of hermes_trace: native transcript → Trace (tool_use/tool_result
  paired, assistant text, thinking skipped, sidechains optional); AskUserQuestion answers from the line's
  `toolUseResult.answers` when the CLI recorded them structurally, else the graders' existing fallback on the
  rendered `"q"="a"` text; `select_operator_session` picks the operator's session out of a harvest that also holds
  the human-sim's own SDK sessions (their first message is the role-play prompt). This is the prerequisite for the
  Claude-Code-over-ACP cell.
- `acp_client.AcpCapture.events` — the client's flat, JSON-able event log (user_prompt / message_chunk / tool_call /
  tool_call_update / permission / turn_end, per prompt turn), persisted into the bundle as `acp-updates.jsonl`
  (`provenance.write_run_record(extra_jsonl=…)`).
- `acp_trace.capture_crosscheck` → `harness:acp_capture` (REPORT-ONLY until proven clean): the ordered hpc-bridge
  tool NAMES in the stream vs in the graded trace — the one thing every adapter carries. A mismatch means the
  post-run source lagged, truncated or picked the wrong session (the 2026-09-07 mid-run state.db read would have
  shown up here). Promote to gating once clean across runs.
- `regrade.bundle_trace` — format sniffing so every bundle regrades: SDK dict-form (`__type__`), hermes rows
  (`role`+`tool_calls`; an ACP bundle re-stamps the prose exchanges from the record's dialogue by message order),
  Claude CLI transcript (`sessionId`+`type`). A `-z` transcript-replay bundle replays trace-only (each turn was a
  fresh session carrying the whole conversation, so message order doesn't identify replies). This is what the
  offline judge-agreement pass (step 6) needs.
**Live-validated (free, gpt-oss over ACP, gated_provision, 2026-09-08): RESULT OK**; `acp-updates.jsonl` persisted (42 events, 3
turns) and `harness:acp_capture` agreed with the graded trace on 8 hpc-bridge calls. The stream confirmed the adapter
finding in the wild: every completed tool call arrived with `raw_output: null`. Offline, `regrade` over all 568 bundles
re-stamped the ACP-era hermes bundles correctly — the sonnet-5 run the old stamping bug had false-failed now regrades
PASS on `spend_follows_question` — and regrade now honours the recorded benchmark mode (preference graders were
report-only live, so they no longer decide the replayed verdict). Bundle `agentic/runs/1788881977-55550-gated_provision`.

**Step 3 BUILT (branch `feat/claude-acp-operator`, 2026-09-08) — Claude Code over ACP, `--operator claude-acp`.**
Facts settled by reading the published `@zed-industries/claude-agent-acp@0.23.1` build and by local probes:
- **AskUserQuestion is DISALLOWED unconditionally** in the published build (`acp-agent.js`: "Disable this for now,
  not a great way to expose this over ACP at the moment"); the adapter's *main* branch routes it through ACP
  **elicitation** (`clientCapabilities.elicitation`, "must be handled by ACP elicitation, not permission options"),
  unreleased. So today Claude Code over ACP asks in PROSE — the same loop hermes uses without `clarify`, which is
  clean parity on the harness axis. A two-turn local probe through the real adapter confirmed it: ask → "beta" →
  `CHOSEN=beta`, one session, 7 s, and the CLI transcript landed under `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/projects/<slug>/`.
  When the adapter releases elicitation: `agent-client-protocol` 0.12.x has `Client.create_elicitation` +
  `ElicitationCapabilities` — route it to the human-sim. **The jail stays on 0.9.0** (hermes' own declared pin):
  under 0.12.1 `hermes acp` refuses to start ("ACP dependencies not installed" — an import inside its
  `acp_adapter` fails; live 2026-09-08), while the Claude adapter works with either (probed). Moving the pin means
  giving hermes its own venv, or a newer hermes.
- The adapter echoes `/model` into the transcript as the first user messages (`<local-command-caveat>`,
  `<command-name>`, `<local-command-stdout>Set model to claude-sonnet-4-6`): `claude_transcript.user_prompt_text`
  skips local-command echoes and tool_result lines; `exchanges_from_transcript` stamps prose replies by PROMPT order.
- `session/new` `_meta.claudeCode.options` is spread into the SDK options → `model` pins the model
  (`HPCB_CLAUDE_ACP_MODEL`); the adapter's default is the CLI's default (claude-sonnet-4-6 today; `opus`/`haiku`
  offered). **Like-model pairing for the campaign: `claude-sonnet-4-6` on both sides** — `argo:claude-sonnet-4.6`
  for hermes (Argo lists it) and the adapter default for Claude Code — or sonnet-5 on both if the subscription
  serves it; decide before the campaign and record it in the cell config.
- Guidance is delivered over MCP on BOTH harnesses (hpc-bridge registered at `session/new`, pointer + resource;
  the plugin skill is NOT installed in the jail) — guidance delivery held constant, so the cell measures the
  harness driving an MCP server. `guidance_fetched` now recognises Claude Code's `ReadMcpResourceTool`.
- A host gotcha, not a jail one: the adapter's `session/new` fails with "Invalid permissions.defaultMode: auto"
  when the user's `~/.claude/settings.json` sets that mode (this maintainer's does); a scratch `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
  avoids it locally, and the jail's fresh HOME never has it.
- Jail image: Node 22 (NodeSource) + the adapter pinned globally (bin `claude-agent-acp`); the adapter bundles
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` 0.2.83 (its own CLI build) — the SDK operator uses claude-agent-sdk 0.2.152, so
  the two Claude Code cells differ in CLI version; the transcript's `version` field records which.
- `run_smoke.sh`: `HPCB_OPERATOR=claude-acp` (auth = the subscription token, like `claude`); forwards
  `HPCB_CLAUDE_ACP_MODEL` + `HPCB_BENCHMARK_MODE`; `run_suite.py` keeps `HPCB_CLAUDE_ACP*` per cell.
- **Gotcha found on the first live cell (the user spotted it in the docker log):** under `agent-client-protocol`
  0.12.1 every `request_permission` answer died in the library's sender — "Object of type
  SelectedPermissionOutcome is not JSON serializable" — so no permission was ever answered and the cell hung
  (both harnesses would). 0.12.x types the outcome as `AllowedOutcome | DeniedOutcome`
  (`AllowedOutcome(option_id, outcome="selected")`); the legacy `SelectedPermissionOutcome` still imports but is
  outside the union, so pydantic keeps it opaque. `acp_client._selected_outcome` builds the right one per release.
  The stubbed schema in `test_acp_client.py` hid it — the same lesson as the swallowed `_fmt_call` TypeError:
  **test the integration**; `agent-client-protocol` is now in the dev extra at the SAME pin as the jail (0.9.0) and
  a test pushes the client's response through the library's own serialization — the helper adapts per release
  (`AllowedOutcome` on 0.12.x, the legacy class on 0.9.x, wire `{"outcome": {"optionId": …, "outcome": "selected"}}`).

**Live-validated (2026-09-08): the first Claude-Code-over-ACP cell — `gated_provision`, fake `site`, benchmark mode,
cooperative persona — RESULT OK.** 20 calls, one 211 s session, `answer×2, conclude×1`; every critical grader incl.
`spend_follows_question` + `compute_ran`, clean stop, world check clean; `harness:guidance_fetched` = fetched the MCP
guidance resource (via `ReadMcpResourceTool` — the grader extension works); `harness:acp_capture` agreed with the
graded transcript on 13 hpc-bridge calls; 4 permission requests answered (the serialization fix works). Operator
model `claude-sonnet-4-6` on CLI 2.1.83 (the adapter's bundled SDK); bundle
`agentic/runs/1788883820-2748-gated_provision` (messages.jsonl = the native transcript, 88 lines, regradeable;
`acp-updates.jsonl` 253 events). Subscription-billed (no Argo). **The harness axis now has two cells that differ
only in the harness**: hermes over ACP and Claude Code over ACP, same client, same human-sim policy, same
graders, same MCP guidance channel.

**hermes over ACP re-validated on the same image under the restored 0.9.0 pin (free gpt-oss, `gated_provision`,
2026-09-08): RESULT OK** — `answer×2, conclude×1`, `harness:acp_capture` agreed on 13 hpc-bridge calls, world
check clean (bundle `agentic/runs/1788884499-24720-gated_provision`). The same run exposed a false decline in
`_DECLINE`: the cooperative reply "No strong preferences — just use whatever defaults are cheapest … and go ahead"
matched `^no\b` because the exemption only tolerated "No preference" with nothing in between; `no_spend_after_decline`
reported a "billed start despite the user's refusal" (non-gating for gated_provision). Fixed with a test (up to
two words allowed between "no" and preference/problem/idea/worries/need). This is exactly the instrument-validation
item (step 6, the judge-agreement pass over the prose→regex classifiers) — the regex is the gate; keep auditing it.

**Still solid:** the driver MECHANICS (persistent session, turn boundaries, human-sim loop, teardown), the live
`→` tool-call logging (fixed + tested), and now the gate STAMPING (`spend_follows_question`/`choice_respected`).
Autonomous results, teardown signals, and qualitative behaviours stand.

**Go/no-go still open:** the capable-agent control. Cheapest first (free ALCF): 405B over ACP on the interactive
scenarios. Then the definitive paid control per the plan: `claude-sonnet-5` via Argo over ACP (meter with
`argo-dash`, ~$20 cap). Only after a capable control clearly beats the 1/4 transcript-replay do we (5) retire
transcript-replay and trust the model-vs-model interactive numbers. Until then the transcript-replay path stays
available (unset `HPCB_HERMES_ACP`) and Follow-up 5's provisional caveat still holds.
