# facility-remote.py — `facility/remote.py`

> [!abstract] Role
> Everything machine-specific for a remote **Slurm or PBS** cluster, behind one [[facility-base|Facility]]: the SSH transport, the per-facility `MachineProfile`, the `globus-compute-endpoint` CLI driver, and `SlurmFacility` (bootstrap / provision / teardown / config template). Despite the name, `SlurmFacility` drives **both** schedulers — the template split, not the class, is scheduler-specific.

## The pieces

- **SSH transport** — `SshTarget` (`:47`) + `ssh_exec()` (`:117`): `BatchMode` (never prompts), reaps the child on timeout/cancel (no process/FD leak). **Identity defers to `~/.ssh/config`** — `user`/`key_path` are optional; absent ⇒ a bare `host` so OpenSSH resolves `User`/`IdentityFile` **and `ProxyJump`** itself (`-i`/`IdentitiesOnly` only with an explicit key). That `ProxyJump` deferral is why a **bastion two-hop** (ALCF Aurora: `bastion.alcf.anl.gov` → login node) is transparent — no new code ([[Aurora (PBS + bastion) bring-up]]). Also drives the un-indexed [[discovery]] probe (`ssh_exec` on a bare target, pre-endpoint). The control channel of [[Two-channel architecture]]; see *Persistent SSH* below.
- **Interactive-auth hand-off** — `is_interactive_auth_failure` (`:146`) recognises a `BatchMode` denial where the server *offers* `password`/`keyboard-interactive` (vs a plain `publickey` refusal or a dead host); the probe raises `NeedsPreauth` (`:157`), which the server turns into `phase="needs_preauth"` carrying `SshTarget.preauth_command()` (`:97`) — the `ssh -fN -o ControlMaster=yes …` line the **user** runs in their own terminal, on the same `%C` ControlPath, so the server's later calls multiplex over the master they opened ([[MFA and interactive SSH auth]]).
- **Per-facility data** — `MachineProfile` (`:197`): host, `env_setup` (module + venv), `interface`, partition, account, scratch, plus **`scheduler`** (`slurm`/`pbs`) and **`cpus_per_node`** (PBS) — supplied by the [[Facility catalog|catalog]] (`profile_from_catalog_entry`, `:222`, which derives `endpoint_name` = `hpc-bridge-<id>` when a seed omits it and resolves `{user}` / `$USER` / `{venv}`), no longer hardcoded per machine.
- **gce driver** — `RemoteEndpointCLI` (`:270`): runs `globus-compute-endpoint` over SSH via `_gce` (`:282`); also `login_exec` (`:286`, backs the `login_shell` tool), `seed_storage_db` (`:357`, [[Credential seeding]]), `configure`/`start`/`stop`, `clean_uep_pidfiles` (`:409`, removes stale per-UEP `daemon.pid` files scoped to the endpoint UUID so a rebuilt worker doesn't hit "Another instance is running" → exit 73 — [#37](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/37); `provision` calls it before a restart), `cancel_blocks` (`:430`, scheduler-aware — `scancel`, or `qdel` via `_cancel_blocks_pbs` (`:466`)), and `close` (`:527`, drops the ControlMaster).
- **Orchestration** — `SlurmFacility` (`:634`): `bootstrap` (`:714`), `provision` (`:753`), `config_template` (`:657`, picks `_SLURM_TEMPLATE` (`:545`) / `_PBS_TEMPLATE` (`:586`) by `profile.scheduler` — [[MEP & templated endpoints]]), `teardown` (`:796`), `manager_online` (`:814`, web), `find_online_endpoint` (`:821`, web reuse).

## How a stand-up flows

`bootstrap` (`:714`) is the entry point, and it is **reuse-or-SSH**: it first asks the Globus *web* service whether we already own an online endpoint (`find_online_endpoint`, `:821`) → reuse over AMQP, **zero SSH**. Only if none is online does it seed credentials (when needed) and call `provision` (`:753`): `configure` if absent → write the engine-free manager `config.yaml` + the scheduler's UEP template → `start` (detached) → capture & **pin** the login node. See [[Standing up the endpoint]] — including how the server rewrites a refused first SSH into `NO SSH ACCESS to <host> as <user>` for a newcomer (`_explain_provision_error`, [[server]]).

> [!warning] Login-node pinning
> The manager lives on ONE login node, but HPC SSH aliases round-robin. `start` (`:386`) captures the FQDN *in the same SSH connection* that launches the daemon (a separate probe could resolve a different node), records it via [[state]]'s `LoginNodeStore`, and the CLI `rebind`s (`:523`) straight there next session. **`_routable_pin` (`:176`) first drops a FQDN that isn't reachable from the client** — an internal suffix (`.local`/`.internal`), a single label, or a **management-plane** name (`hostmgmt`/`cm`/`mgmt`/`ipmi`/`bmc` labels, e.g. Aurora's `aurora-uan-0009.hostmgmt.cm.aurora.alcf.anl.gov`) — falling back to the alias, so a non-routable pin can't break teardown/reconnect ([#33](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/pull/33)).

> [!warning] PBS cancel reads bare `qstat -f`, never `-u`
> Slurm block-release matches `squeue -u`, but PBS Pro's `-u` filter suppresses full-format output entirely — so `_cancel_blocks_pbs` (`:466`) uses bare `qstat -f` (unwrapping its 80-col line continuations) scoped by the endpoint-unique `uep.<eid>` marker → `qdel`. A `-u` filter would silently no-op and let the block burn to walltime (caught in live Polaris validation, [#28](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/28)). The marker scoping means it never touches another endpoint's jobs, same as the Slurm path.

> [!warning] `gce list` parsing is fail-loud
> `status`/`endpoint_id` parse `gce list`'s ASCII pipe-table via `_parsed_rows` (`:320`); a gce version/format change **raises** rather than being misread as "no endpoints" (which would trigger a wrong re-provision). See [#8](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/8).

> [!note] Persistent SSH (ControlMaster) — authenticate once
> `SshTarget.argv` (`:66`) appends `ControlMaster=auto` + a `%C`-keyed `ControlPath` + `ControlPersist` (configured by `_control_settings`, [[server]]) when a socket dir is set, so all of a facility's SSH — the ~10-call cold bootstrap *and* the [[discovery]] probe — rides **one authenticated connection**. On a key facility the master opens non-interactively; on an MFA facility the user pre-opens it once (one Duo) and the server's `BatchMode` calls multiplex over it. `close` (`:527`) tears it down (`ssh -O exit`); `ControlPersist` self-reaps regardless. *(Honest nuance: the post-`start` `rebind` to the pinned node means a cold bootstrap ends with two masters — alias + node — so 2 auths, not 1; still decisive vs ~10.)* The socket dir is kept **short** by `_short_control_dir` ([[server]]): ssh checks the whole expanded `ControlPath` against the Unix socket cap (~104 bytes on macOS), so a deep `HPC_BRIDGE_STATE_DIR` would fail every SSH with `ControlPath too long` before authentication ([#50](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/50)).

> [!note] Endpoint reuse (zero-SSH reconnect)
> `find_online_endpoint` reuse is the keystone that lets a reconnect session avoid SSH **entirely** — one of two MFA mitigations (the other is persistent SSH, above) ([#3](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/3)). It gates on `manager_online` **alone — no liveness probe** (a probe can't tell a dead ghost from a cold-starting fresh worker); a dead "online" ghost is instead recovered downstream, where the robust [[Warmth, the canary & cold-start|canary]] maps its shut-down Executor to `provisioning` ([#37](https://github.com/ryanchard/hpc-bridge/issues/37)). See [[Two-channel architecture]] and [[Discovery today]].

## Issue #39 — the "registration lag" that was a wrapped table (fixed 2026-09-04)

`globus-compute-endpoint list` renders an 80-column table when there is no TTY (how `_gce` runs it over SSH) and wraps
an Endpoint Name longer than ~27 characters onto a second row. `_list_rows` parses per line and matches the name cell
exactly, so `hpc-bridge-<fqdn>` names (and the harness's per-run names) were never found: the first `details=` connect
failed with "could not find endpoint … in `list` output", the retry's `status()` missed too, re-ran `start` and hit
"Another instance is running". Recovery only worked because `find_online_endpoint` asks the web service by name.
Measured live on globus1 (gce 4.13); reproduced hermetically with the captured table (`tests/test_remote_facility.py`,
the `test_39_*` tests). Three changes in `RemoteEndpointCLI`: `_gce` exports `COLUMNS=400` (honoured without a TTY);
`start` polls for the UUID for up to 30 s (the detached daemon registers ~3.6 s after `start` returns) via
`_await_endpoint_id`; a refused `start` whose manager is already running adopts it instead of failing (gce 4.13 exits 73 with
NOTHING on either stream, so the check is `status(name) == "running"`, not the "Another instance" text). The robust follow-up remains issue #8: read `endpoint.json` / the pid file instead of parsing the table.

## Host trust (security review 2026-09-04)

`SshTarget.argv` no longer overrides `StrictHostKeyChecking` (it was `accept-new`): hpc-bridge trusts exactly what the
user's own `ssh` trusts — OpenSSH's default refuses an unknown host under `BatchMode`, and any relaxation in
`~/.ssh/config` applies. An unknown/changed key surfaces as `UNKNOWN HOST KEY` (notices) with the remedy in the user's
own terminal; while a pin is in use the pin is dropped like `CANNOT REACH`. A login-node PIN (`rebind`) sets
`HostKeyAlias=<resolved HostName of the alias>` (via `ssh -G`, because known_hosts is keyed by the resolved name, found
live) so a pin can never redirect the seeded credential to a machine whose key differs. `--` precedes the destination
in every argv; hosts are allowlisted at the model boundary (`models.SAFE_HOST`) and again in `SshTarget.__post_init__`;
`preauth_command` is shell-quoted. `teardown(wipe_credentials=True)` is what `teardown_endpoint` now calls.
