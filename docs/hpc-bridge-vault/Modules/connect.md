# connect

> [!abstract] Role
> The connect flow the agent drives: the Globus login gate FIRST, the resolution ladder (explicit details this session → the registry → the local BYO cache → the SSH probe that proposes a config), the switch of shapes/state to the bound facility, the identity-blind MEP attach or the SSH bootstrap, the allocation listing over the free login shape. Also `_commit_proven_facility` (a BYO config is cached only once the login-shape canary answered) and `_drop_dead_pin` (an unreachable login-node pin is forgotten).

Split step 10 (2026-09-03) — the last. The login-shape channel is injected (`run_login`) as in [[scheduler_ops]]; `server._connect_facility` is a thin wrapper supplying `server._login_runner(app)`, so the many tests that call it and patch `server._run_shell` keep working. Tests that patch the probe patch `connect.discover_facility_details` / `connect._propose_or_ask`. Concepts: [[Happy path]], [[Discovery today]], [[Facility catalog]], [[In-terminal Globus login]].

## Consent is per conversation; a fresh bootstrap is proven (live findings, 2026-09-04)

Three fresh-user sessions on globus1 showed: (1) the connect right after our own `bootstrap` re-finds the endpoint online
and reads as `reused` — which skipped the proven-cache commit forever and told the agent it had "reused an already-online
endpoint" seconds after a fresh start. `AppCtx.bootstrapped_facilities` records the facilities THIS session bootstrapped;
`_commit_proven_facility` skips only a reuse of an endpoint from before the session, `_reuse_note` says "reconnected to
the endpoint this session started", and the result's `reused` flag is False for our own start. (2) Claude Code's
auto-memory carried a previous session's "confirmed config" into the next one and the agent registered the facility
without asking — the proposal notice now says the confirmation must come from the user in THIS conversation and that the
probe must not be re-run over the agent's own ssh. (3) On the silent (wait-and-continue) login path nothing named the
identity that landed; `_connect_facility` now prefixes "Globus login landed as <identity>" to the result.
